<h2 class="nobreak">IN APPRECIATION OF WILLIAM F. CODY<br />

<small>(BUFFALO BILL).</small></h2></div>


<p>It is now some generations since Josh Billings, Ned
Buntline, and Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, intimate friends
of Colonel William F. Cody, used to forgather in the
office of Francis S. Smith, then proprietor of the <i>New
York Weekly</i>. It was a dingy little office on Rose Street,
New York, but the breath of the great outdoors stirred
there when these old-timers got together. As a result of
these conversations, Colonel Ingraham and Ned Buntline
began to write of the adventures of Buffalo Bill
for Street &amp; Smith.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa, February
26, 1846. Before he had reached his teens, his
father, Isaac Cody, with his mother and two sisters,
migrated to Kansas, which at that time was little more
than a wilderness.</p>

<p>When the elder Cody was killed shortly afterward in
the Kansas &#8220;Border War,&#8221; young Bill assumed the difficult
r√¥le of family breadwinner. During 1860, and until
the outbreak of the Civil War, Cody lived the arduous
life of a pony-express rider. Cody volunteered his services
as government scout and guide and served throughout
the Civil War with Generals McNeil and A. J.
Smith. He was a distinguished member of the Seventh
Kansas Cavalry.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, while riding through the streets
of St. Louis, Cody rescued a frightened schoolgirl from
a band of annoyers. In true romantic style, Cody and
Louisa Federci, the girl, were married March 6, 1866.</p>

<p>In 1867 Cody was employed to furnish a specified
amount of buffalo meat to the construction men at work
on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It was in this period
that he received the sobriquet &#8220;Buffalo Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1868 and for four years thereafter Colonel Cody
served as scout and guide in campaigns against the Sioux
and Cheyenne Indians. It was General Sheridan who
conferred on Cody the honor of chief of scouts of the
command.</p>

<p>After completing a period of service in the Nebraska
legislature, Cody joined the Fifth Cavalry in 1876, and
was again appointed chief of scouts.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody&#8217;s fame had reached the East long before,
and a great many New Yorkers went out to see
him and join in his buffalo hunts, including such men
as August Belmont, James Gordon Bennett, Anson
Stager, and J. G. Heckscher. In entertaining these
visitors at Fort McPherson, Cody was accustomed to
arrange wild-West exhibitions. In return his friends
invited him to visit New York. It was upon seeing his
first play in the metropolis that Cody conceived the idea
of going into the show business.</p>

<p>Assisted by Ned Buntline, novelist, and Colonel Ingraham,
he started his &#8220;Wild West&#8221; show, which later
developed and expanded into &#8220;A Congress of the Rough-riders
of the World,&#8221; first presented at Omaha, Nebraska.
In time it became a familiar yearly entertainment
in the great cities of this country and Europe.
Many famous personages attended the performances, and
became his warm friends, including Mr. Gladstone, the
Marquis of Lorne, King Edward, Queen Victoria, and
the Prince of Wales, now King of England.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Sioux, in 1890 and 1891,
Colonel Cody served at the head of the Nebraska National
Guard. In 1895 Cody took up the development
of Wyoming Valley by introducing irrigation. Not long
afterward he became judge advocate general of the
Wyoming National Guard.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) died in Denver, Colorado,
on January 10, 1917. His legacy to a grateful world was
a large share in the development of the West, and a
multitude of achievements in horsemanship, marksmanship,
and endurance that will live for ages. His life
will continue to be a leading example of the manliness,
courage, and devotion to duty that belonged to a picturesque
phase of American life now passed, like the great
patriot whose career it typified, into the Great Beyond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>&#8220;RED DICK&#8221; AND &#8220;FIGHTING DAN.&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p>It had come out of the long familiar war between the
cattlemen and sheepmen. &#8220;Red Dick&#8221; and &#8220;Doc&#8221; Downs,
cattlemen, were on trial for the shooting of Josh and
Cabe Grey, sheep herders, and the slaughter of three hundred
sheep. A typical Western crowd had drifted into
Bozeman, including many soldiers from Fort Ellis. It
was noon and the sun hung high and blazed down relentlessly
on the perspiring spectators, as they poured out of
the stuffy courtroom, at recess. Red Dick and Doc
Downs were to be taken across the street to the hotel for
lunch, and the crowd settled across the way to cheer or
hiss the prisoners, as its sympathies dictated, as the handcuffed
men were led forth by the officers.</p>

<p>Red Dick was known as a bad man and he looked the
part. He stood six feet three in his stockings, was
straight as an arrow, and, without an ounce of superfluous
flesh, weighed 190 pounds. Contrary to the suggestion
of his cognomen, he was not of Indian descent, but below
the belt of tan at his neck the unbuttoned collar revealed
skin as white as marble. It was a mass of curly, fiery-red
hair that had given Richard Davids, from Vermont, his
nickname in the West.</p>

<p>Red Dick&#8217;s steely gray eyes flashed, his hawk-bill nose
sniffed contemptuously, and his short-cropped red mustache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
twitched nervously as he was led out of the courtroom
and the hiss of his enemies fell on his ears.</p>

<p>Then came hoots and howls and verbal insults, intermingled
with &#8220;tigers!&#8221; and &#8220;good boy, Dick!&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stand by you, Red!&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>At one time it seemed probable that the factional spirit
among the spectators would lead to riot, as the feeling
ran high and the crowd began surging back and forth
about the prisoners, preventing the advance of the officers
in charge.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a commotion far down the
street, a clatter of pounding hoofs, a wild yell and a
fusillade of revolver shots. Then there burst on the
view of the crowd a figure so startling as to, for the
moment, drive all thoughts of the prisoners from the
minds of the wrangling spectators.</p>

<p>It was a great, rawboned, buckskin stallion, tearing
up the main thoroughfare at a terrific pace, headed
directly at the startled crowd. Astride the animal was a
man to match&mdash;a tall, gaunt, broad-shouldered fellow in
buckskin trousers and red flannel shirt, his long mustache
sweeping back about his neck and fluttering in the
wind with the corners of the handkerchief knotted there.
In each hand the recognized &#8220;bad man&#8221; carried a big
revolver with which he was boring holes in the ether
by way of announcing his approach.</p>

<p>The horse, with wide-distended nostrils and showing
belts of white around the iris of its eyes, dashed madly
at the crowd, which scattered like chaff.</p>

<p>Almost upon the officers and their prisoners the big
rider yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>

<p>The animal stopped so suddenly that it sat upon its
haunches and slid for a yard or two while the rider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
seemed almost precipitated over its suddenly dropped
head.</p>

<p>He landed squarely in front of the officers, his towering
height now seen to the full, with a gun in each hand,
and leaning far forward until his black and flashing
eyes were on a level with those of Red Dick, he bellowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;So yo&#8217;re ther skunk thet plugged my brothers, air ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick, with all his boasted bravery and deeds of
dare-deviltry, cowered before the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;Fighting Dan&#8217; Grey!&#8221; gasped the crowd, as it
scurried for quarters beyond the line of the big guns,
which they felt sure were soon to be in action.</p>

<p>The officers shrank, too, and reached for their own
guns in a half-hearted way.</p>

<p>Big Fighting Dan disdained the motion to draw on
him, except to roar:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep yer pepper boxes under yer co&#8217;t tails, officers, er
it&#8217;ll be bad fer yer digestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so yo&#8217;re it! hey?&#8221; he boomed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, yo&#8217;re in ther han&#8217;s o&#8217; ther law, jes&#8217; now, an&#8217;
old Dan respects ther law, but Heaven hev mercy on yore
pesky hide if I ever set my eyes onto yuh outside o&#8217;
ther clutches o&#8217; ther sheriff an&#8217; his men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shoving his guns into his belt, the dark man continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m hyar an&#8217; yo&#8217;re hyar, so now&#8217;s ther time ter
pay my complerments&mdash;an&#8217; thar yew hev um!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had suddenly reached forward, and, before the officers
could protest or others divine his intention, he had
grasped Red Dick by the chin with one hand and by the
curling red hair with the other, and tipped the prisoner&#8217;s
head far back. Then an amber stream left Dan&#8217;s dark
lips, and Red Dick&#8217;s face ran with tobacco juice as he
was released, a spluttering, raving, helpless wretch, while
Fighting Dan turned away, swung into his saddle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with a few parting shots dashed down the street and disappeared.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the dazed condition of the crowd,
the officers hurried their prisoners into the hotel.</p>

<p>Red Dick&#8217;s handcuffs were removed to allow him to
wash the tobacco stains from his face, but he was in too
much of a rage to eat. He sat and indulged in savage
mutterings by way of intrenchment of his vow to torture
Fighting Dan at the stake, if he&mdash;Dick&mdash;ever got
out of the grip of the law.</p>

<p>Doc Downs had little to say. He had escaped the
wrath of Fighting Dan, for which he was thankful, and
the sympathy and hatred of the crowd seemed to centre
on Red Dick, rather than on him.</p>

<p>Doc was shrewd enough to keep still and remain in
the background. Doc was not a practicing physician,
as one might infer from his nickname. If there was
anything which Doc knew less about than another, it
was the application of drugs or the uses of lance and
bandage. For some reason which never had been explained,
Doc&#8217;s parents had given him the prefix &#8220;Modoc.&#8221;
As a boy he had been &#8220;Mo,&#8221; and then &#8220;Mod,&#8221; now
&#8220;Doc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doc wasn&#8217;t smart enough to be a first-class bad man,
although he had aspirations in that direction, and he
was too indolent to earn an honest living. So, when
Red Dick, the dashing cowboy, blew into town one day
and flourished a wad that would have blocked the pathway
of a four-year-old steer, Doc hitched onto the tail
of the curly-haired comet.</p>

<p>There was one thing Doc could do&mdash;cook&mdash;and by
means of that seldom-exercised talent he had won the
favor of Red Dick.</p>

<p>Doc&#8217;s allegiance to his employer had got him into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fuss. With Red he had flourished guns and swaggered
before the sheepmen on the ranges. And one day,
when the mix-up came with the Greys, Doc had closed
his eyes and blazed away as Red Dick had done. When
he saw the Greys down, rolling on the ground and groaning,
he became panicky and would have bolted, but for
Red Dick, who ordered that every sheep on the section
be shot. Then the two had spent the remainder of the
day in riding down and slaughtering the innocent animals.</p>

<p>Doc was sorry, and he had no hesitation about saying
so&mdash;when Red Dick was beyond hearing.</p>

<p>The sympathies of the cattle raisers were with Red
Dick, even at this early day, for they had begun to feel
the increasing encroachment of the sheep herders on the
range. The sheepmen backed the Greys, who had been
seriously wounded in the encounter, as well as sufferers
financially in the loss of three hundred sheep. The
Greys were quiet, peaceable ranchers, and considered
honest by those who knew them.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan was the black sheep in the Grey family.
Dan was big, and fierce, and courageous, and a
gambler. He tore big holes in the atmosphere and made
lots of noise, but he had never killed his man, in spite
of his reputation. Dan&#8217;s favorite method was physical,
unarmed violence. Two ordinary men were as boys in
his grasp. He delighted in seizing a disputant at cards,
to whirl the victim high above the top of his own head,
which was six feet and a half above the floor.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan had once taken possession of a saloon
that had won his disfavor, and poured liquor down the
proprietor&#8217;s throat until he was unconscious. Dan had
then set up the drinks for everybody in sight for half
a day.</p>

CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE BAD MAN.</small></h2></div>


<p>The night of the opening day of the trial of Red Dick,
Buffalo Bill and several of his pards struck town. With
the scout were Hickok, Little Cayuse, and Skibo, the
giant negro. Old Nomad was on the way, and might be
expected to &#8220;lite&#8221; at any hour.</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s orders were direct from the secretary of
the interior at Washington. The encroachments of the
cattlemen and sheepmen upon the Indian reservations
and various clashes with the red men were breeding discontent,
and promised a serious outbreak. Buffalo Bill
had been instructed, also, to quietly look into the conduct
of some of the Indian agents in the Northwest.
Complaints were finding their way to Washington, and
the rival political party was making campaign material
out of them.</p>

<p>If the Indians were being cheated and robbed by unprincipled
officers, the department wished to make an
example of said officers and preserve peace and the good
will of the Indians.</p>

<p>Intruders were flocking upon the Indian lands in
search of gold, and herds of the white men grazed where
no human foot had the right to set, except that of the
red man. The buffaloes, which were the main source of
food supply for the Indians, were slain by thousands.
Excursionists and others shot the animals, and their
putrefying carcasses thickly dotted the plains.</p>

<p>It was coming to the knowledge of officials in Washington
that there was an &#8220;Indian ring,&#8221; which included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a corrupt gang of miscreants at the national capital in
league with others in the West. Through this band of
rascals the Indians were provided with worthless rags
for blankets and wretched meat in place of the supplies
called for by treaty contract and provided by the government.</p>

<p>By the manipulations of unscrupulous agents and land
thieves the cultivated lands of the Indians were being
taken from them, and tracts of deserts substituted.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill well knew that the whites were trampling
on the rights of the red men, and his sympathies were
known among both shades of skin.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull, the famous chief, had always hated the
palefaces, and, nursing the wrongs of his people, he now
refused to sign a treaty giving up certain lands. He
had been threatened by bumptious officials, and on the
strength of these threats he had gone among the powerful
Sioux tribes, and exhorted them to prepare for war.</p>

<p>Such men as Generals Sheridan, Canby, Miles, Custer,
and others foresaw serious difficulty with the Indians
at a time when the general public in the East had been
lulled into a sense of security in the belief that the Indian
question had been settled for all time.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill&#8217;s mission was to soothe and quiet the Indians,
so far as possible; at the same time he was bringing
to justice the leaders in as corrupt a gang as ever
went unhanged. He found the whites not only robbing
the red men, but at war among themselves over grazing
rights.</p>

<p>Enforcement of the law was a farce, and right was
much a case of might.</p>

<p>Bad men flourished and boasted themselves terrors of
the universe. These wild and woolly fellows seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
met, but exercised their blatant powers over the more
submissive portion of the public.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill&#8217;s arrival had not been heralded, and he
was not recognized at the most pretentious hostelry of
the Gallatin Valley. With his pards he made up a quiet
little party, who might have been attracted to town by
the trial. No one seemed interested to the point of curiosity,
and the scout was gratified that it was so. The
men he was after might not so soon take alarm.</p>

<p>It was a typical border aggregation that thronged the
tavern that night, the air filled with tobacco smoke and
fumes of liquor and vibrating with loud talk.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Fighting Dan Grey appeared. He
was &#8220;liquored up&#8221; and looking for trouble. He was
dodged by all who could avoid him, but led men by twos
and threes to the bar to drink his health. He was well
supplied with the yellow metal, and everybody had to
drink whom he invited.</p>

<p>Later Dan&#8217;s mood changed, and he wanted to play
cards. He roped in one man, and desired two others.
Far back in a corner the scout and the Laramie man sat
smoking and watching the constantly changing aspect of
a night gathering of Westerners going through all stages
of acquiring a state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan espied them, and led his victim thither.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyar are ther ombrays thet I propose ter hev er game
er cyards with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan slammed a table across in front of the scout and
Hickok, churned the partner he had impressed into service
into a chair opposite one for himself, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar! I reckon the&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a game. Hyar,
yew long-haired fellar, ketch holt an&#8217; shake &#8217;em out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill smilingly humored the big, black bad man,
whose counterpart in character he had seen many times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Hickok, too, sat in good-naturedly, and the quartette
proceeded in a friendly game. The scout and the Laramie
man won the first hand, and then Fighting Dan insisted
that all go to the bar and &#8220;wash &#8217;er down&#8221; at his
expense.</p>

<p>The scout and Hickok declined. The bad man was in
a towering rage at once. He smote the table with a
bang that attracted the attention of every man in the
room, and then he bellowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;So yer refuses to swaller pizen with me, does ye?
Waal, Dan Grey won&#8217;t eat that kind o&#8217; dirt fr&#8217;m no long-haired
ombray this side o&#8217; Tophet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill sat calmly and smilingly, awaiting the subsidence
of the bad man&#8217;s spasm.</p>

<p>Hickok held the deck, and idly shuffled the cards over
and over. The other seized the opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>Half a hundred men turned all attention to the corner
where sat the unruffled scout confronted by the roaring,
dark-visaged giant.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse had entered, followed by Skibo. They
were attracted to the scene at once. Skibo edged through
the crowd until he was at Buffalo Bill&#8217;s back, and said
in an undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, Mars&#8217; Billyum, but don&#8217;t you want ole
Skibo to squelch &#8217;im?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Skibo; thanks. I guess it will soon blow
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it didn&#8217;t blow over, and the bad man worked himself
into a perfect frenzy while raving at the unterrified
scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a pin wheel o&#8217; you over my head,&#8221; he
roared, leaning forward and grasping Buffalo Bill by
the shoulders.</p>

<p>When he had done that the man from Laramie suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
kicked the table over, and left nothing between
the bad man and his intended victim.</p>

<p>Dan attempted to change the hold of one of his huge
hands from the scout&#8217;s shoulder to the thigh for his
usual spectacular performance, but he found his own
wrist suddenly caught in a viselike grip.</p>

<p>The bad man struggled for the release of his arm,
for a moment, and was manifestly surprised that he
could not readily wrench the imprisoned member from
the grasp of any man.</p>

<p>And then, before he realized the possibility of such a
happening, the bad man felt his opponent step in close,
and the next instant he was whirling through the air, to
land on a table and crash with it to the floor.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan got up slowly, and for a moment stared
at the scout in dazed surprise; then he reached for his
guns. Before his hands had fairly touched their butts
he found himself peering into the sinister-looking muzzle
of the scout&#8217;s rigid revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, amigo!&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter
shoot; I was on&#8217;y goin&#8217; ter take off me weapons an&#8217; git
ready ter mop up this hyar barroom with ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, neighbor; if that is your game I&#8217;m agreeable.&#8221;
And without a quiver the scout handed his own
gun to Hickok and stepped forward.</p>

<p>Dan deliberately laid his big revolvers on a table, spat
on his hands, and then suddenly rushed.</p>

<p>The scout did not expect such a move from the previous
deliberate movements, but he was not caught at a
disadvantage. Wheeling like a flash, he caught the big
fellow, half-buttocked him, and stretched the giant
breathless on his back on the floor. The crowd cheered,
and Fighting Dan regained his feet slowly, a sadder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
wiser bad man. He had never suffered such humiliation
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who be yew, amigo?&#8221; he asked, extending his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; answered Buffalo Bill; &#8220;I have never been
ashamed of my name, but for to-night it is not to be
made public property. I am steering my own canoe
without instructions, and I don&#8217;t drink at any man&#8217;s order.
I am willing to go some distance to please, but it
is the business of no man here what my name may be.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his pards pushed through the cheering
barroom gathering which had increased to a mob,
and made their way to their rooms on the floor above.</p>

<p>After the scout had left the discomfited Dan relieved
his mind as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;By ther rip-roarin&#8217; Jeehokibus! That there tarnal
is a hull cyclone an&#8217; a few whirlwinds ter boot.&#8221;</p>

<small>WILD BILL DISAPPEARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill had hoped to escape recognition for a
time until he could look into conditions in that locality,
but he was not to be so fortunate, as he learned the moment
the four pards were alone in their large double
room.</p>

<p>Bozeman was only one of many of the older towns
the scout expected to visit, in prosecution of his mission,
to rout the rogues who were stealing both from the government
and the nation&#8217;s charge, the red man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka make um listen,&#8221; said Cayuse, as soon
as the door had closed upon the outside. &#8220;Heap bad
palefaces call Long Hair &#8216;Buffalo Bill.&#8217; Pards in home
of Great Father tell on string and talks. Pa-e-has-ka get
letter come Virginia City. Bad Crow warriors wait in
pass, shoot Pa-e-has-ka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get that?&#8221; asked the scout of his Indian
boy pard.</p>

<p>&#8220;All same make um believe sleep on floor Red Tiger
Saloon; hear bad paleface talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you learn their names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One Jim Price, other all same Dave. Jim give
Crows bad blankets, bad meat, bad whisky. Dave sell
Indians sand for hunting grounds, Jim pay Dave good
blankets, good meat, good rum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see; Price is the Indian agent, and Dave is a land
shark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they are going to send me a fake message, purporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to come by wire from Washington, to report at
Virginia City. Then on the way I am to be ambushed
and shot by Crow bandits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do these fellows hang out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All same Red Tiger&mdash;drink heap rum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had better run over to the Red Tiger for
a little while before turning in,&#8221; remarked the scout,
once more buckling on his belt which he had removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me go?&#8221; asked Cayuse, an appealing look in his
black eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ole Skibo like pow&#8217;ful well to tote along, Mar&#8217;s
Billyum,&#8221; urged the colored giant.</p>

<p>The scout laughed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you wish, but I think it would pay you better
to turn in and sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sentiments, pard,&#8221; added Wild Bill, as he sought
the bed.</p>

<p>The other three went out quietly at a side door without
meeting any one, and the noisy crowd in the barroom
drowned all sound of their egress. Five minutes&#8217;
walk brought them to the Red Tiger Saloon, a place of
ill repute, even for this wild country. There the cutthroats
and gamblers congregated, and scarcely a week
in the year passed without its tragedy at the Red Tiger.
Card disputes sometimes ended in wholesale shooting,
and, only two weeks before, three funerals resulted from
one night&#8217;s rough house in the infamous inn.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill and his pards arrived the crowd
had reached a stage of drunkenness which dulled its perception,
and the strangers were unnoticed. Several men
were stretched out on benches and floor in drunken
stupor, and others were drinking or wrangling as to
whose turn it was to treat. Others were attempting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with drunken persistence, to play cards, but the stakes
at the corners were knocked about by gesticulating elbows,
and coins rolled about the floor.</p>

<p>Cayuse looked about for a moment, and then approached
the scout. In a low tone he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Price play cards with heap fool drunks; steal um
money; Dave drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout easily picked out Price, and when opportunity
offered approached unnoticed. He also secured
a good look at the debauched face of Dave, so that he
could recognize the fellow if they ever met again.</p>

<p>Price was too drunk to be acute, but he was still
sharp enough to rake in all the money of those with
whom he was pretending to play.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill closely watched the manipulations of this
representative of Uncle Sam, and was soon convinced
that the fellow was an unmitigated scoundrel who would
rob his best friend if opportunity offered.</p>

<p>One man at the table, a miner, had been robbed of his
last cent, despite his protest of unfairness. And then the
inevitable row was started. The victim bunglingly attempted
to pull a gun, and his motion was followed by
half a dozen others who were grouped about the table.</p>

<p>Price was not so far intoxicated as the others, and
deftly jerked a gun to a level with the other&#8217;s breast.
Somebody in the crowd accidentally or otherwise discharged
a revolver. A fusillade followed, principally
into the floor and ceiling, but when the smoke cleared
the man who had been robbed by Price was on the floor
writhing with a bullet through his body, and Price was
pushing through the drunken, shouting men with a
smoking revolver in his hand. He had shot the man he
had robbed and was getting away before officers arrived.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>There was no doubt regarding who had shot the
miner, in the mind of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not care to be held to testify in the
pretended investigation which was bound to follow, so
he and his friends slipped away. The report of the coroner
would be the usual one: &#8220;Shot by an unknown
in a volley by barroom crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the scout awaited for a time the action of the
town&#8217;s protectors. In half an hour the sheriff arrived,
and in another half hour the Western coroner came to
take charge of the remains.</p>

<p>Justice certainly did not move on the &#8220;hot foot&#8221; in that
city of &#8220;courage juice&#8221; and bad men.</p>

<p>As the scout and his faithful negro and Indian pards
were moving away there came a terrific explosion from
the direction of the hotel. A moment later a red glare
sprang up, and then hoarse shouts and screams of anguish
rent the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be a boiler explosion,&#8221; exclaimed the scout,
hastening on, &#8220;and at or near the hotel,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>His worst fears were realized. The disaster had occurred
at the hotel, but it was not a boiler explosion.
The entire wing in which Buffalo Bill and his pards had
been assigned quarters had been blown up by some powerful
explosive.</p>

<p>No other explanation was possible than that some one
had placed a heavy explosive under the wing with malicious
intent, the proprietor, who was soon found by
Buffalo Bill, declared.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people flocked to the scene, and among
them Buffalo Bill sought for his pard, Wild Bill Hickok,
the man from Laramie, the hero of scores of daring exploits.</p>

<p>The wing was wrecked and the hotel burning, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
scout still hoped that by some miracle his partner had
escaped.</p>

<p>The night wore away, and the fire was conquered only
when the hotel was in ashes. Two other guests of the
hotel were missing, and half a dozen had been more or
less seriously injured.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill haunted the scene of disaster. He could
not give up hope that Hickok had escaped. But no clue
was uncovered that led to any other conclusion than that
Wild Bill had perished miserably.</p>

<p>Then Buffalo Bill began an investigation on his own
hook to discover the author of the tragedy. Lambert,
the hotel proprietor, had no idea regarding the miscreant
or his object. He&mdash;Lambert&mdash;did not know that he
had an enemy, and he could not imagine the object of
any man in destroying his property, and at the same
time taking the lives of innocent people.</p>

<p>The scout began to suspect that he and his pards were
the object of the dynamiters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were there any inquiries yesterday,&#8221; he suddenly
asked of Lambert, &#8220;concerning the sleeping quarters of
any of your guests?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hotel man started, and then answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Dave Green asked me about you and your party&mdash;who
you were and what rooms you had. He said he
guessed he would see if he couldn&#8217;t sell you a quarter
section up the valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was with him at the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Price, the Indian agent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see either of these men about town after the
explosion last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw Price, and he said Green was laid away,
ossified, at the Red Tiger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon after the explosion did Price appear?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Why, he showed up while we were trying to pull the
people out of the wreck before the fire drove us away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t suspect Jim Price of anything like
that, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought he might prove to be a good witness
if an inquiry was made,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>In his own mind Buffalo Bill was satisfied that Price
had attempted to blow the scout and his pards into
eternity. So far as brave Hickok was concerned it
seemed that the wretch had been successful.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had succeeded better than he had expected
in the beginning of the unraveling of the government&#8217;s
skein of Indian difficulties.</p>

<small>BUFFALO BILL&#8217;S LITTLE JOKE.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Waugh! Of all ther sky-whoopin&#8217; heifercats, that

but layin&#8217; on fat an&#8217; a-storin&#8217; up devilment fer more&#8217;n er

pard, Wild Bill? I&#8217;m jest er itchin&#8217; ter git my claw dogs
outer his flipper. Whar&#8217;s Hickok?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad, Buffalo Bill&#8217;s trapper pard had &#8220;lit&#8221; after
a long lay-off to nurse the injuries received through an
accident. He arrived at Bozeman the next day after the
fire, and lost no time in locating the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nick, old pard, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you,&#8221; the scout
answered. &#8220;The hotel was partly blown up night before
last, and the section our room was in was knocked to
splinters. Hickok was in the room asleep at the time,
or at least we left him there, and he has not been seen
since. The ruins have not cooled sufficiently so that we
can find the body.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bluff and rough old trapper, who loved a fight
and feared nothing, dropped back forlornly, and swept
the perspiration from his brow with rough palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it, Buffler! It jest cain&#8217;t be so! No,
no, Buffler, our true-blue pard Hickok warn&#8217;t born ter
be blowed up by a coward skunk. No, sir, Buffler, Wild
Bill hain&#8217;t dead, an&#8217; he hain&#8217;t been dead. When Hickok<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
dies it&#8217;ll be a honorable death&mdash;er facin&#8217; ther moosic an&#8217;
er gun in &#8217;is fist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad bounced out of his chair and out of his
grief, ready for business, having convinced himself that
his pard still lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feels it in my bones, Buffler, thet Hickok is er goin&#8217;
ter show up&mdash;hat, taps, an&#8217; britches&mdash;et jest ther proper
minuit ter save some of our scalps, same&#8217;s he allers does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, Nick! Your confidence renews my
hope. Let&#8217;s get busy with the work in hand and be prepared
to welcome our Laramie pard properly when he
comes back. I&#8217;m prime glad to see you in harness again,
Nick, and I am anxious to introduce our new pard to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gut er new pard, Buffler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of er chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a light-complexioned little fellow, who joined us
for his health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We call him &#8216;Skibo.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, you knows yer own bus&#8217;ness best, Buffler, but
this here outfit hain&#8217;t no horspital corps, nor no reesort
for nussin&#8217; babies. I sh&#8217;d think ther place fer er consumptive
wuz in er home somewhar, whar ther smell
er powder wouldn&#8217;t make &#8217;im faint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stands hearty victuals first-rate, Nick. I have
seen him turn pale only once, and that was when a dead
greaser came swimming down the river after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I&#8217;m glad ter know a dead greaser c&#8217;n swim,
fer I hain&#8217;t never seen er live one what could. Whar is
ther new pard&mdash;an&#8217; thet thar redskin papoose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Cayuse and Skibo have ridden out to a ranch
to see the games to-day. A chap named Carson is celebrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his wedding, and is giving the boys a blow-out
and a programme of sports. He offers good prizes for
best riding, roping, tying, shooting, jumping, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go, Buffer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I preferred to stay here to see if I couldn&#8217;t locate the
body of Hickok.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, yer can&#8217;t, &#8217;cause he hain&#8217;t hyar! Yer mought
jest ez well quit yer mopin&#8217; an&#8217; come erlong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going, Nick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore! The&#8217; hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter be no prizes ter waste
thet yer Uncle Nick can gobble onter. Not noways ef
Nick knows hisself, an&#8217; I think he do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the Carson ranch were gathered about three hundred
miners and cowpunchers to partake of the hospitality
of one of their number, swear allegiance to the new
bride, and strive for the prizes in the day&#8217;s contests.</p>

<p>Out of respect for the bride&#8217;s request, the courage
juice was indulged in moderately, and Buffalo Bill
thought it about as orderly a crowd of the kind as he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>The events were well under way when the scout and
old Nomad arrived, but the latter immediately made inquiries
regarding his entry to the events. They found
Cayuse and Skibo, and the colored pard was introduced
to Nomad by Buffalo Bill, who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nick, I want you to shake hands with our new pard,
Skibo. Skibo, this is old Nomad, of whom you have
heard us often speak. Nick, when you shake his hand,
go easy, or you may hurt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper stared in amazement at the huge negro,
who had been described to him as a light-complexioned
little weakling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;Waugh! Little&mdash;as er nine-y&#8217;ar-old buffler bull!
Light-complexioned&mdash;as ther bottom ov er chimney pot!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was sort of exclamatory soliloquy, but the trapper
was none the less hearty in greeting the grinning
colored man when he got around to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are ye, Skibo? Buffler told me ter look fer er
consumptive cuss, an&#8217; you s&#8217;prised me. So you turned
pale when you saw a dead greaser er swimmin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yar, yar! Dat&#8217;s what Ah done. Ah specs Ah was
whiter&#8217;n you be fer &#8217;bout two whole minutes&mdash;an&#8217; dat
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t much of a day for gittin&#8217; white, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lookahyar! Don&#8217;t yer go fer ter hingin&#8217; on my pinkan&#8217;-white
complexion, &#8217;cause yo&#8217;re so blamed dusky er
smut coal would make er white mark on yore skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yar, yar! Mars&#8217; Nick. Yo&#8217; shore is er white-libered,
delekit-lookin&#8217; blossom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grinning pair, still shooting nonsense at each
other, grasped hands, and old Nomad, who had a grip
like the jaws of a rock crusher, found his match.</p>

<p>Nick and Skibo were bound to be good friends from
that hour. There was no color line among Buffalo Bill&#8217;s
pards, and Skibo felt that he was considered an equal.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse greeted Nomad with usual stoical mien,
and remarked with twinkling eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide-rack heap fool mule; Navi all same pigeon&mdash;go
like bullet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Yeow little yaller rascal, Hide-rack will run
over yore measly pinto some day; see if &#8217;e don&#8217;t. Hide-rack&#8217;s
ther best anermile south o&#8217; ther old Missou, &#8217;cept
Bear Paw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Heap bones! Stumble much, fall down
mountain, break Nomad neck. Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The party stood near the corral watching a pony race
as the entries scored down to the mark and were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
sweep away across the plain for a mile. Forty men were
in saddle in the race. Others had galloped far down the
course, and few were left about the ranch.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Carson, the proprietor, were cantering
leisurely down the field, and the new bride had climbed
to the seat of a prairie schooner to watch the contest,
rather than to remain longer in the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell yer what I&#8217;ll do, Piute; I&#8217;ll race yer down behind
ther crowd ter see ther run, an&#8217; if yer git thar fust
I&#8217;ll buy yer ther purtiest young cannon in Bozeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; acquiesced Cayuse, and the pair mounted and
rode away.</p>

<p>Skibo was tired of riding, and disposed his form
against the corral fence in as comfortable position as
possible. He heard an uproar among the cows and
horses within, but before he could arise to investigate
there came a terrific crash, and a great Texan bull burst
from the inclosure.</p>

<p>Excited first by the shouting and shooting, and then
infuriated by the glimpse of darting ponies and the
cheers of the men as the field got away, the animal in its
frantic plunging had broken loose, dashed through the
herd, and swept the fence away like a row of jackstraws.</p>

<p>The first thing that caught the brute&#8217;s eye when he
had gained liberty was a straw stack. He darted at it
with lowered head, and amused himself for a moment by
goring it. Then he turned and saw the white-covered
wagon with the frightened young woman upon it, and
dangling from one of the wheels the bright red pontiac
of a miner.</p>

<p>The animal had really considered the straw stack a
joke, and seemed to be at play, but that red coat set his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
passions aflame. With a maddened roar he pawed the
earth and sent the gravel flying high in air.</p>

<p>Several cowpunchers far down the field heard the
commotion and recognized its import at once. They put
spurs to their ponies and tore madly back, yet they knew
they could not hope to reach roping or even shooting
distance before the fierce brute would charge the
schooner with its helpless cargo&mdash;the fair bride they
had come to honor.</p>

<p>The cowboys&#8217; yells had attracted the attention of
others, and soon the course swarmed with excited men
and horses, racing toward the scene of pending tragedy.</p>

<p>The bellowing of the bull rumbled faintly above that
of pounding hoofs.</p>

<p>These brave men of the plains, in a mission of life and
death, drove the rowels into the sides of their steeds.</p>

<p>And then the foremost saw the brute charge, in spite
of their yells to turn his attention to them. But even
as they looked at the flying bull they saw a human being
bound out from the corral across the path of the bull.</p>

<p>It was Skibo!</p>

<p>There the giant negro stood, with tense muscles,
slightly crouching, facing the oncoming animal, unarmed.</p>

<p>The bloodshot eyes of the bull caught the new object
in its path, and the brute slowed down for reconnaissance.
It came to a dead stop within ten feet of the human
form which disputed its progress.</p>

<p>But the pause was brief, for the colored man darted
in like a flash, and seized the wide-spreadin&#8217;, needle-like
horns of the bull.</p>

<p>Then began such a struggle for mastery between man
and beast as the West had never seen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>It was not the battle of powder, and lead, and steel
against brute flesh, but the conflict of brawn and brawn.</p>

<p>The animal in a perfect fury tried to hurl its antagonist
off, and to trample, and gore the powerful man,
who stooped to no form of torture to win the mastery.</p>

<p>Forward and back they surged, the negro&#8217;s great neck
muscles standing out as he clung to the horns of the
bull, and gradually forced the shaggy head to an acute
angle, the nose pointing to one side and the horns another.</p>

<p>All the giant&#8217;s weight and great strength were thrown
into this feat, and, like bands of steel, the muscles of the
bare, walnut-colored arms held every inch gained.</p>

<p>The nose of the brute was now near the earth, and in
that unnatural position both seeing and breathing were
difficult. The animal&#8217;s breath came in hoarse, wheezy
snorts, and he staggered as he plunged about, always endeavoring
to throw off the foe.</p>

<p>How long could the brave man hold such terrific
strain?</p>

<p>The terrified bride, with clasped hands, forgot her own
peril in her anxiety for the safety of her rescuer.</p>

<p>The approaching cowboys dared not shoot for fear of
injuring the negro. With whirling lariat they dashed
nearer, but their aid was not needed.</p>

<p>With a superhuman effort Skibo had suddenly
wrenched the animal&#8217;s nose upward until the bull lost its
equilibrium and plunged sidewise to land feet up and
horns driven into the ground.</p>

<p>Skibo had slipped one hand from horn to nostrils as the
animal fell, and then, standing on the horns, with both
hands holding the panting snout, he had the bull helpless
and at his mercy.</p>

<p>In that position the colored man waited for the cowboys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to rope the beast, and then modestly attempted to
steal away.</p>

<p>But his escape this time was out of the question. Poor
Skibo dearly paid for his heroism by becoming the object
of such hero worship, and cheers, and slaps, and handshakes
that he heartily wished the ground would open
and swallow him up.</p>

<p>And to cap the climax the bride came forward, and,
after thanking him in sweetest way and words, and while
tears chased each other down her cheeks, and admiring
miners and cowboys stood with uncovered heads, she unfastened
from her throat a massive gold brooch, and with
her own hands pinned it to Skibo&#8217;s trembling shirt front&mdash;&#8220;to
remind you,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;of one who will ever
and often think gratefully of you.&#8221;</p>

<small>HOW HICKOK CAME TO GRIEF.</small></h2></div>


<p>Sleeping with his window wide open, as was his custom,
&#8220;Wild Bill&#8221; Hickok, Buffalo Bill&#8217;s pard from
Laramie, had been awakened by the shooting at the Red
Tiger. His first thought was that his pards were in
trouble, and, hastily donning his clothes and buckling
on his belt, he did not pause to stumble along the corridors
and through the crowd of inquisitive loungers, but
sprang through the window and landed lightly on the
soft earth twelve feet below.</p>

<p>As Hickok approached the Red Tiger, he could see the
tall forms of the scout and of Skibo, and knew that they
were all right. He would have entered, but, standing in
the shadow of a building to reconnoitre, he saw something
to change his plans.</p>

<p>Some one passed an open window with a lighted lamp,
the rays of which fell upon two men conversing in whispers
not twenty feet from him. Hickok recognized one
of the men as the sheriff of the county, and the other,
he felt quite sure, was the man who had been pointed out
as the local Indian agent.</p>

<p>Wild Bill was curious to know what their private confab
was about, for he had intuition that it concerned the
arrival of Buffalo Bill and his pards.</p>

<p>Hickok glanced about him for means of getting closer
to the pair. Near him was a door opening into the corner
of the building which seemed to be some sort of a
low warehouse,. He tried the door, and it opened readily
at his touch; then he stepped inside and softly closed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
door behind him. He felt like a burglar, and had no
means of knowing what sort of a place it was, because it
would not do to strike a match. The windows were uncurtained,
and he had noticed that the two men stood
close to one of them.</p>

<p>Once more the lamp passed a window in the adjoining
building and revealed enough of Hickok&#8217;s surroundings
to enable him to proceed. He was in a hallway that led
to a room in the back and a stair to the story above.
Along the corridor next the stairs were tiered barrels of
flour, sugar, and pork, but next the outer wall a passage
had been left to the room in the rear of the building.</p>

<p>The man from Laramie approached the window near
which the men were talking, and, crouching there, could
see their heads above the sill clearly outlined against the
light of a stable lantern far down the street.</p>

<p>Hickok was wondering how he could raise the window
within a foot of the heads of the men without their detecting
him, when he discovered that he could hear their
whisperings plainly. A pane of glass was gone, and he
wondered why they had not heard him.</p>

<p>The first words Hickok distinguished were:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll have to go through the performance
of investigating the case, but don&#8217;t ring me in, and Dave
was dead drunk all through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll have to hold some o&#8217; the boys for witnesses,
but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; in till I think all them that knows anything
about it has got away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Rus, do you know what Cody is here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s after me first, and Dave, and you, and
anybody he can find who is mixed up in this Indian graft.
I got a wire from Reynolds to be on my guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff whistled softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;Does he know you yet?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he arrived at the wrong time. The trial has
brought in so many strangers that it is pretty hard work
telling who from which.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been sent here by Washington authorities.
How did they git wise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody has leaked to make political capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could get Buffalo Bill out of the way without
direct suspicion, we would be safe for a long time&mdash;but
how to get rid of him is the problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we get him outside on some pretext and
have him ambushed by Indians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dave and I planned that, but Sitting Bull has raked
in our renegades and taken them down the Yellowstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What rooms do Cody and his men have at the hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The big one in the north wing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we get at &#8217;em there, some way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking of that. How would it work to
try &#8216;Bloody Ike&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do it if there was a hundred plunkerino in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can have it, and fifty dollars extra for every one
of Cody&#8217;s men he gets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is in the Red Tiger now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Rus, when you go in send Ike out here to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian agent moved a few feet to one side and sat
down on a box. Hickok was disappointed. He feared
he could not hear the conversation between the agent and
Bloody Ike. But his present position was the best he
could do. He would wait.</p>

<p>Just then something happened that caused him for the
moment to forget the man on the box and look to his
own safety. He heard a step on the platform outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a key inserted in the lock, and some one began fumbling
with it. The Laramie man bounded behind some barrels,
and crouched there.</p>

<p>The intruder, who was trying to unlock a door that
was not locked, finally entered, struck a match, and
glanced down the corridor and up the stairs, and then
went out, securely locking the door after him and trying
it several times after he had locked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see where I&#8217;m liable to arrest for &#8216;breaking and
entering,&#8217;&#8221; murmured Wild Bill, as he once more
crouched by the window.</p>

<p>Bloody Ike soon came, and held a long confab with
the Indian agent, very little of which Hickok could hear.</p>

<p>As they passed the window moving away, the listening
Hickok heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, make a clean job of it. Fumbles don&#8217;t count.
You must settle this Buffalo Bill&#8217;s hash and as many of
the others as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be able to do it right; I&#8217;ve handled the
stuff for fifteen years in the mines&mdash;and in some other
places.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last was spoken significantly.</p>

<p>Hickok was anxious to follow the fellows and prevent
a tragedy. He had no fears for the safety of Buffalo
Bill and his pards, because he had several times seen
them about the saloon. He did not believe the Indian
agent and Bloody Ike would attempt anything that night,
but he wished to follow them and learn more of their
plans.</p>

<p>Hickok tried the window, and found it fastened with a
heavy prop over the lower sash. It required but a moment
to remove this, raise the sash, and leap to the
ground, but in that time the men he was after had disappeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>The Laramie man hastened down the street in the direction
they had gone, hoping to catch sight of them,
but they had either entered some dive or had seen something
to alarm them, and consequently fled.</p>

<p>Hickok finally went back to the Red Tiger, hoping
to pick up his pards if he discovered no further knowledge
of the plot to destroy not only Cody, but his comrades.
The man from Laramie had not discovered the
means by which they were to be disposed of, but he had
learned that these men were desperate enough to stoop
to any crime in order to continue their process of wholesale
robbery of the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>He took a peep inside, but none of his pards were
there. The coroner and sheriff were present and several
hangers-on.</p>

<p>Hickok hurried away again, determined to get back to
the hotel at once and tell Buffalo Bill what he had
learned. He had not covered one-half the distance when
there came a thunderous crash that made the surrounding
low buildings rock.</p>

<p>Hickok paused to locate the direction of the explosion,
which seemed to have come from all points of the compass
at once. As he looked a familiar figure darted out
from between two buildings and made down the street,
keeping in the shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bloody Ike or I&#8217;m an ape,&#8221; muttered the Laramie
man, taking up the pursuit.</p>

<p>Out of the settlement dashed pursued and pursuer,
the latter confident that the former had been up to some
deviltry and feeling that in some way it concerned himself
and Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Half a mile out Bloody Ike reached an encampment of
Indian traders who had several horses tethered on the
plain. Hickok was near enough, crouched in the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and weeds, to hear the conversation. The man wanted
to buy a pony, and soon struck up a trade. Without even
a saddle he mounted and rode away.</p>

<p>He was hardly out of sight before the Laramie man
was bartering for a pony. He had noted one in particular
that he wanted, for the little fellow was doing its
best to get away and follow the animal ridden by Bloody
Ike.</p>

<p>Hickok paid a generous price, and the moment he
mounted the pony dashed out on the plain, in the direction
taken by Bloody Ike, at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the Laramie man to himself, &#8220;I guess I can
follow the trail if it is dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned well forward on the animal&#8217;s neck, and
watched its ears outlined against the sky. At every attempt
to whinny he slipped his hat over the pony&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p>After half an hour&#8217;s riding Hickok heard the whinny
of a pony, clear and loud, not one hundred yards ahead.
The animal he rode would have answered had he not
jerked it suddenly back upon its haunches, and then
dismounting slipped his hand over its nose until he
could prepare a muzzle from the pocket of his heavy
coat.</p>

<p>As soon as he was in the saddle, the pony again dashed
ahead, as if determined to overtake the animal ridden by
Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>The chase led into the foothills and then the rockier,
harder climbing. Hickok kept a sharp lookout ahead, for
he well knew that the pony he bestrode would overtake
the other if possible, and he did not care to come upon
Bloody Ike unexpectedly when the latter had halted and
discovered that he was pursued.</p>

<p>As yet Hickok believed that his presence was unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the man ahead, but in this he soon discovered that he
was mistaken, and to his own cost.</p>

<p>Pulling his pony to a standstill in a rough defile,
Hickok listened for hoofbeats. Then almost at the pony&#8217;s
feet he saw a spark, crawling and sputtering toward him.</p>

<p>Hickok hesitated not an instant, but drove the spurs
into the animal&#8217;s sides, and it leaped to one side with a
startled snort.</p>

<p>The pony&#8217;s jump took it over the edge of the narrow
trail, where it lost its footing, and rider and horse rolled
down a sharp declivity just as an explosion shook the
hills and flying rock showered about them as they
plunged into unknown depths.</p>

<small>THE BATTLE IN THE MINE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Skibo was the hero of the occasion and had won the
grand prize. Indeed, almost any one of the cowboys
and miners would have risked his life a dozen times for
the words or the gift of the bride. But probably no
man among all those assembled there could have performed
the feat of strength of the giant negro.</p>

<p>Back in town that night the news of Skibo&#8217;s wrestle
with a bull had preceded him, and the modest darky was
obliged to retire supperless to his room and remain
there to escape the crowd that swarmed about the hotel
to see him.</p>

<p>That night Buffalo Bill superintended a crew which
removed the d√©bris of the wrecked and burned hotel
wing. No bodies were found, and a great feeling of relief
swept over the scout.</p>

<p>But what had become of Hickok? was the question.
He had dropped out of sight as completely as if the
ground had opened and swallowed him. No one had
seen him since he retired that night, and his partners
had left for the Red Tiger.</p>

<p>The scout determined to make an active search of the
town and surrounding country at once. He more than
half suspected Price had in some way been concerned
in the disappearance of the Laramie man. He had confided
his fears and suspicions to Little Cayuse, and the
clever Indian boy was at work in his own way, while the
scout was watching the removal of the burned timbers
from the hotel ruins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>When Buffalo Bill and old Nomad retired, well toward
morning, Little Cayuse had not returned.</p>

<p>Two of the pards already had dropped from the roster
in the war on rascality as practiced against &#8220;Poor Lo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s thet papoose, Buffler?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I suspect that our Piute pard is
hunting for Hickok. Cayuse is a boy of few words and
many deeds. He tells what he wishes to do after it is
accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s jest his caper, an&#8217; if he don&#8217;t strike er hoof
mark it&#8217;s er mighty blind trail ter Wild Bill&#8217;s dodge
corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little fearful that Hickok started an investigation
of his own and has fallen into a trap of some sort.
These men are bad ones, and would not hesitate at any
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was ther rumpus t&#8217;other night er celebration in yer
honor, Buffler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the blow-up was intended for me and my
pards, and it was only by a fortunate move of the wheel
of fortune that all of us escaped. We must locate
Hickok next at any cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with yer, Buffler, ez long&#8217;s thar&#8217;s any wind in my
bellowses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Skibo was snoring loudly, and Pa-e-has-ka and Nomad
were about to seek rest, when Cayuse entered the room
as silently as a spectre, and apparently under considerable
excitement. He approached Buffalo Bill, and, after
looking about as if fearing the walls had ears, said in
low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka make um listen! Wild Bill chase heap
bad man over plains into hills after blow-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that, Cayuse?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;Find um Injun sell ponies Bloody Ike and all same
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sun come up here, him go that way,&#8221; answered Cayuse,
pointing southward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Middle sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hickok has always shown great ability to take
care of himself, but if he doesn&#8217;t turn up in the morning
we&#8217;ll take a look down that way to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cayuse better go now?&#8221; asked the boy, his black
eyes containing more of appeal than his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to-night, boy; but in the morning after you
have rested and slept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Cayuse all same not squaw,&#8221; complained the
Piute, as he sought his hammock, for he could not be
induced to sleep in a white man&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>Wild Bill had not arrived in the early morning, so
Buffalo Bill and his three pards set out, their horses in
fine fettle for the gallop into the foothills. They first
visited the encampment of Crows who were peddling
beads and baskets, and got a good description of Wild
Bill, also the man of whom he was in pursuit and known
to the Indians as Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>At noon they were far into the hills and had discovered
evidences of recent human occupancy of the mouth
of an abandoned mining shaft.</p>

<p>They entered and explored for some distance, but decided
that the bird had flown.</p>

<p>Outside again Cayuse left the others, and his pinto
took up the work of trailing with exceeding care. Half
an hour later he returned and hurried Pa-e-has-ka away
to look at a discovery.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill found evidence of a recent explosion in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
trail that led to the old mine by another way than they
had come. For rods around the ground was covered
with newly shivered rock, and a great mass had
crashed down the mountainside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remain here, Cayuse,&#8221; said the scout, after
studying the situation for a moment; &#8220;I am going down
into the gulch. If I am not back in an hour leave Skibo
to guard the horses, and with Nomad follow my trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; was the only reply of the Indian boy.</p>

<p>More than one hundred feet down the sharp and
rocky incline the scout came upon the carcass of a pony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said, &#8220;the trail was mined, and horse and
rider blown over the brink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Careful search revealed no trace of his pard, but still
farther down he found the bushes beaten down, as
though a body had been dragged.</p>

<p>It was what he had half feared since finding the evidence
of a mined path&mdash;Hickok had been killed by a
bomb and his body dragged away to dump into some old
mine shaft or otherwise hidden from possible searchers.</p>

<p>The scout followed the trail for some distance in the
brush along the base of the dump, and then came to a
sharp angle in the rock, where a narrow shelf led down
a circuitous way, apparently into the mouth of another
entrance to the mine above, at a lower level.</p>

<p>The scout crept cautiously forward, ready for instant
action if Bloody Ike or his pals were expecting callers.</p>

<p>But not even Buffalo Bill was prepared for the move
which was adopted by the wretch hidden in the rocks
above.</p>

<p>The scout heard a slight movement above him, and instinctively
sprang forward and in close to the wall. As
he did so a great mass of rock came hurtling down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
struck the shelf where he had stood, and crashed onward
into the abyss below.</p>

<p>Pa-e-has-ka was well concealed in his present position
behind jutting rocks and a tangle of bushes and vines.
By leaning far forward and peering upward through the
thick foliage he commanded a view of the cliff above
from whence the slide had started. He saw a wicked,
bewhiskered face peering over the edge and anxiously
scanning the deeper chasm below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess that fixed &#8217;im!&#8221; the scout heard the man
chuckle. &#8220;Waal, that disposes of two of &#8217;em that we
know about. Guess ole Long Hair won&#8217;t sashay round
here huntin&#8217; trouble right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was tempted to put a bullet in the evil
brain, but he had never yet pointed a gun at an unarmed
or unprepared human being, be he ever so bad. He
would await his opportunity to take the fellow back
where he would receive just and legal punishment for
his crimes.</p>

<p>Making his way cautiously into the mouth of the shaft,
the scout secreted himself in a dark angle behind the rotting
timbers, convinced that the fellow above would go
to the base of the cliff to satisfy himself that his victim
had been crushed to pulp in the avalanche of rock.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. He saw the fellow clamber
nimbly down from his hiding place, apparently well acquainted
with every detail of the mountainside.</p>

<p>The fellow came within three rods of the entrance,
and then suddenly swung over the edge of the rocky
precipice, and was lost to view.</p>

<p>A moment later Buffalo Bill crept out and peered over
the edge. He saw the man below him making his way
from rock to rock, clinging to bushes and roots, and descending
into the ca√±on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>The scout drew back and decided to explore the shaft
for a short distance while the tenant was absent. He believed
Bloody Ike was hiding here until the investigation
following the destruction of the hotel had blown over.</p>

<p>He found his suspicions confirmed. In an alcove in
the incline he discovered a rude cot of straw and blankets,
and far down the one-time muleway he heard a pony
whinny.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he keeps his pony in here, too,&#8221; mused the scout.</p>

<p>But just then he was startled by a human groan near
at hand and promptly forgot the pony.</p>

<p>Striking a match, the scout eagerly scanned the place,
and beheld a sight that sent thrills half joy and half uncertainty
to his brain, while a feeling of rage swept over
him.</p>

<p>It was the form of Wild Bill lying on a pile of mouldy
hay, bound hand and foot and a rude gag in his mouth.
The Laramie man&#8217;s bruised face and head made him an
object of pity. His face, hands, and clothing were
soaked in blood and eyes closed in semi-conscious condition.</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s ready knife slashed the cords which bound
his pard, and then he looked around. Near the cot was
a pail filled with water, probably for the pony. Cody
quickly brought it to the side of his wounded friend, and,
kneeling, slopped the water freely in Hickok&#8217;s face and
laved his brow and head, washing away the blood and
gravel.</p>

<p>He was rewarded in a few moments by seeing the
Laramie man open his eyes and by hearing him faintly
ask: &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With friends, old man; lie still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout chafed the hands and wrists of his pard
and laid a wet handkerchief on the fevered brow. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
poured a little of the water down the parching throat,
and was gently fanning the injured man with his hat
when he heard a slight scuff of a shoe, and, glancing up,
beheld Bloody Ike just entering the shaft.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s eyes had not become accustomed to the
darkness, and he groped his way toward his cot, swearing
to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know whether I got the ombray or not. Landslide
was bigger&#8217;n I expected,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon have your mind set at rest!&#8221; shouted
Buffalo Bill, as with a bound like a panther he was upon
the wretch.</p>

<p>The man attempted to reach knife or gun, but was too
slow, and then a fierce struggle began.</p>

<p>For a minute or two they wrestled, and then both went
down, with the scout on top. The rascal was frantically
endeavoring to draw a revolver when a smashing blow
from the scout&#8217;s fist ended the set-to.</p>

<p>In two minutes more Bloody Ike was securely bound
and had been dumped none too gently on his cot. Then
the scout went to the mouth of the cavern and sent forth
a prolonged &#8220;Hoo-hoo-o-o!&#8221; for his pards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>RED DICK&#8217;S CHOICE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Everything possible for the comfort of Wild Bill was
done by his pards. Little Cayuse on the fleet Navi made
all speed to Bozeman for a doctor, while Nomad and
Skibo prepared a shelter in the open air, and the injured
man was removed from the foul atmosphere of the old
mine.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not send for the sheriff, because he
had already planned to &#8220;put the kibosh&#8221; on the chief
county officer in the general round-up which he hoped
would soon follow. These men were not to be tried before
a local court. In fact, he had cause to distrust the
court itself. Some things he had seen had led him to
suspect that the local judge was in league with Price
and the others. And as for a jury drawn from the countryside,
Price had furnished liquor for too many of them
for the scout to take any chances.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was aware that the most dangerous element
of the &#8220;ring&#8221; was in Washington. There the plots
were laid and such men as Price located where they
could do the most good&mdash;or bad, as viewed from the
standpoint of right and honesty. If other stations were
as rotten at the core as this one there was work ahead
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, like Kit Carson and other famous scouts,
had learned to sympathize with the red men and to befriend
these simple people in every way possible.</p>

<p>The prisoner, known as Bloody Ike, refused to hold
any conversation with the scout at first, venting his feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in voluminous tirades and heaping vituperation
upon them.</p>

<p>Then Skibo lost his temper at some vile abuse, and,
seizing the villain by the belt and shoulder, raised him
above his head, as though he was about to hurl him over
the precipice.</p>

<p>Ike lost his nerve and begged for mercy. He was
lowered to the ground and the powerful grip released
only when he had promised to cease his abusive language.</p>

<p>The doctor came and pronounced Hickok on the road
to recovery. He had suffered external injuries, and the
lack of attention and resulting fever had done the rest.
With his temperature at nearly normal, his mind cleared
up, and all he needed was care and light food for a day
or two.</p>

<p>The scout was impressed by the quiet earnestness of
the professional man. There was much in his bearing to
inspire confidence. The scout wondered why this university-bred
youth had chosen such a remote field.</p>

<p>Beyond earshot of Bloody Ike the physician asked why
the man was bound. The scout frankly told him, and
was rewarded by much valuable information concerning
the working of this gang of gamblers, thieves, and cutthroats.
The physician said the better element of the
people feared for their property and lives if they openly
opposed these thugs, of whom Price was the acknowledged
head.</p>

<p>Before departing the physician assured the scout that
he should anxiously await a successful outcome of the
latter&#8217;s mission, and said that if any information of
value to the pards was discovered he would find some
means to communicate with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>It may be interesting to note here, while we are awaiting
the recovery of Wild Bill, that the trial of Red Dick
had ended in acquittal and the cattlemen were consequently
jubilant and proposed to celebrate in honor of
the event. The sheepmen and their friends withdrew,
but many threats were made, and everybody realized that
the end was far away and might yet embrace many tragedies.</p>

<p>Red Dick proposed to celebrate in his own way. He
made a great amount of loud talk about hunting down
and filling Fighting Dan with cold lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix him so he can&#8217;t swim,&#8221; raved the would-be
terror of the town.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan was said to be hanging out near Three
Fork, and his friends hastened to send him word that
Red Dick was on his trail.</p>

<p>Red Dick first proceeded to organize a gang of his
satellites to accompany him to Three Fork&mdash;&#8220;to see him
&#8216;do up&#8217; Fighting Dan.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dozen men on horseback galloped away on their
avowed mission of murder, Red Dick dashing ahead and
proclaiming in fearful language the things he would do
to Fighting Dan. Some of those who knew Red Dick
best declared that he was blowing his horn much louder
now than when he considered himself within hearing distance
of Dan Grey.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, standing on the heights and looking
northward, saw a party of horsemen galloping away
from Bozeman to the northwest. The scout&#8217;s interest
was aroused at once. He wondered where this strong
party of riders were going and what could be their mission.
He could see an occasional white puff of smoke
and knew that the men were firing.</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s first thought was that it was a party sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
out by Price to run down his own&mdash;Buffalo Bill&#8217;s&mdash;party.
If that was the case they were on the wrong trail at the
start.</p>

<p>Watching the party well out of sight, the scout returned
to the camp ground and ordered Cayuse to saddle
Bear Paw and Navi and prepare the bags for a long ride.
He told Nomad and Skibo to keep constant watch over
Hickok and the prisoner until his return; then briefly
outlined what he had seen and his decision to look into
the matter.</p>

<p>In half an hour the scout and Little Cayuse were galloping
northward at a brisk pace, keeping well to the
westward of town, so as not to attract attention.</p>

<p>They forded the Gallatin, then rode along the valley,
keeping the river in view. The scout hoped by hard
riding to get within view of the horsemen before dark.</p>

<p>The sun was barely two hours high, and from a slight
elevation where they had pulled in to allow the horses
to breathe the scout was scanning the plain through a
field glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed at last. &#8220;I was searching too far
for them. Cayuse, I think we are in for some fun. Our
men are trying to cross the river, and the ford is high
and running wild. I guess they must have had a cloudburst
to the northward yesterday or last night. Those
fellows are attempting to reach our side of the river,
but I don&#8217;t think they have seen us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Mebbe so we got near in cottonwood, watch
um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good notion, Cayuse,&#8221; answered the scout, reining
Bear Paw toward the river bottom, along which
were dense thickets of willow and cottonwood.</p>

<p>A mile farther on they halted in the thick green
growth from which they could watch the man&oelig;uvres of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the party on the opposite shore. Several ponies were
dripping on the bank, as though their riders had attempted
to stem the current and had given it up.</p>

<p>A group of half a dozen were working over one man,
occasionally holding him up by the heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him all same drink too much,&#8221; observed Cayuse.</p>

<p>The scout smiled, but he was watching something far
up river. At first he thought it a cabin that had been
swept away. Then he decided that it was a great tree
that had been uprooted and torn from its footing.</p>

<p>Nearer it came in the raging river, and, finally, as the
party on the opposite side discovered it, they began dashing
about, shouting and gesticulating, as if apparently
they had formed some plan to utilize the tree in crossing.</p>

<p>The scout and Cayuse were interested but unseen spectators,
and at last they saw what these cowboys hoped
to do.</p>

<p>In the middle of the river was a jutting ledge. If the
tree, which was whirling in mid-stream, would strike the
ledge and swing around they would attempt to rope the
end next to them. If successful and the sweep of the
great lever could be held, they could cling to rope and
tree and reach the shoal water on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The floating tree could not have behaved better. It
struck the ledge branches foremost, slid along until more
than half its length had passed the rock, and then
paused, the current gradually swinging the roots toward
the bank on which the men were waiting.</p>

<p>With a cheer several cowboys rode into the river with
ready riatas. As the butt swung slowly but steadily
toward them, two coils swept through the air and settled
over a stout root which had been broken. Galloping up
the bank, the men made the ropes fast in a clump of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cottonwoods, and were ready for another attempt to
cross the river.</p>

<p>The current was increasing every moment, and even
though the worst part of the torrent was spanned it was
no easy job to gain the other side.</p>

<p>Up to this time Buffalo Bill had not discovered that he
recognized any of the party, but now a tall man rode
down on a rangy sorrel horse and headed across.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him all same Red Dick,&#8221; said Little Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is!&#8221; exclaimed the scout. &#8220;Now, I can surmise
what they are here for. Red has either escaped or been
acquitted. If the former he is making a getaway. If
the latter he is hunting for Fighting Dan to get square.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick chose the up-river side of the lariats and
reached the roots of the tree in good order, his horse
swimming nobly, but it was a struggle to round the roots
and gain the trunk, where it seemed harder work for the
tired animal. The water sucked under the great log and
threatened to pull both horse and rider down, too.</p>

<p>Then Red Dick clambered from the saddle to the tree
trunk holding the bridle and both relieving the animal of
his weight and helping its progress by the rein.</p>

<p>At the bushy top Red Dick&#8217;s progress was slow and
difficult. He clambered over and through the branches,
clinging to the rein and handicapping the horse. He had
nearly reached the top, and was preparing for the last
desperate struggle, when there came a startling interruption
that promised disaster.</p>

<p>All eyes had been fixed on the progress of Red Dick,
and no one had seen another tree which came sweeping
along on the side of the river next the party of cowboys.</p>

<p>As Red Dick, clinging with one hand to the branches
and with the other to his horse&#8217;s bridle, was about to
launch himself into the saddle, the second derelict struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the taut lariats, and carried the roots of the first tree
downstream, while the top in which Red Dick was
perched swept upstream against the current at ten miles
an hour.</p>

<p>The horse was swept under and Red Dick doused to
the top of his sombrero. But he clung to the branches
and came up sputtering and gasping.</p>

<p>The horse arose and gained the bank, where it began
to crop the grass unconcernedly.</p>

<p>The anchor ropes had snapped under the strain, and
the second tree had sailed on, but the first still clung to
the rock, only it had changed position, and, instead of
being across the current, the heavier root held its place
downstream, and the top bobbed up and down in the
washing waves above the rocks.</p>

<p>There Red Dick clung desperately and bellowed for
help. The water forced him in among the branches, so
that he could not pull himself up over them and gain
anything like a comfortable position on top. And now
and then the surging waters seemed to delight in lifting
the butt and roots of the tree and ducking the red topknot
of Dick in the murky depths.</p>

<p>At this stage a second party of horsemen appeared at
the ford, on the side where the scout and Cayuse sat
watching the fun. It was Fighting Dan and half a
dozen well-armed sheepmen who had evidently set out
for town.</p>

<p>They took in the situation and Red Dick&#8217;s predicament.
Fighting Dan slid from his saddle and haw-hawed
long and loud, slapping his buckskins and shaking his
head in glee. His men, too, joined in a merry chorus,
but kept their fingers on the triggers of their rifles, for
across the river were twice their number of the enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;So yer lookin&#8217; fer me, are ye, Red?&#8221; yelled Dan, his
voice echoing above the roar of the angry waters.</p>

<p>Red couldn&#8217;t reply just then, for one of his periodical
duckings was coming.</p>

<p>When he came up choking, Fighting Dan resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Better look out er ye&#8217;ll put out ther fire in that ole
red pate o&#8217; yourn! Say, Red, honest now, what makes
ye go in swimmin&#8217; when ther drink is so muddy? Take
yer medercine coollike, Red, &#8217;cause yer know arter er
chap shoots up his betters an&#8217; gits &#8217;quitted, fate allers
does this ter &#8217;im, ter cool &#8217;im off.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;, then, ergin, Red, if yer can part comp&#8217;ny with
that thar tree long ernough ter come over hyar I&#8217;ll lend
ye some dry ammernution fer yer gun, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll play
high rooster in ther grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick made no reply to the taunts of Dan. He
was in no position to offer offense or defense. He was
becoming tired and hopeless. He could see that no move
had been made toward his rescue; in fact, there seemed
nothing the men could do.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan rode down in the water to his horse&#8217;s
sides and shouted to Red Dick:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Red, blamed &#8217;f I b&#8217;lieve yer was born ter be
drownded&mdash;yer&#8217;d look better hangin&#8217;. An&#8217; I hates ter set
hyar an&#8217; see yer miss yer fate. What yer say, Red, had
ye druther slop under an&#8217; die now like er man er come
ershore an&#8217; take yer charnces with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick gasped: &#8220;Save me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fighting Dan slowly uncoiled his lariat, then he
watched the loops as he arranged them immediately, and
then turned to Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hates ter do it an&#8217; I hates not ter, so thar ye be,
Red. I&#8217;m goin &#8217;ter try ye once an&#8217; &#8217;f I git ye, yer hangs.
Thet&#8217;s fair, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The riata was swirling slowly about the dark man&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>The rope seethed through the air, and settled about
Red&#8217;s neck, and was drawn taut, just as he was going
under again.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan wheeled his horse and dug his spurs
deep. The animal splashed furiously up the bank, while
the swirling body of Red Dick at the end of the lariat
fairly made the water boil.</p>

<p>Fighting Dan slid from his horse, loosened the coils
about Red&#8217;s neck, threw the half-conscious man over on
his face, and gave him a resounding slap between the
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shore missed drowndin&#8217; by ther skin o&#8217; yer
neck,&#8221; remarked Dan, as the gasping, nearly suffocated
man showed signs of reviving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see &#8217;f I hadn&#8217;t skun yer neck with ther rope ye&#8217;d
been swimmin&#8217; fer Davy Jones&#8217; place o&#8217; business now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ye goin&#8217; ter do with me?&#8221; croaked Red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer fate ain&#8217;t fully settled yet, Red, but I shore think
hangin&#8217; is much more becomin&#8217; ter yore style er beauty;
don&#8217;t yer, Red?&#8221;</p>

<small>PA-E-HAS-KA TRAPPED.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill watched Fighting Dan out of sight with
his prisoner. About the latter&#8217;s neck a lariat was tied
just tight enough so as not to be choking, yet too close
to permit of being slipped. The prisoner was allowed to
cling to the saddlehorn and run by the side of the easily
loping horse&mdash;and so they disappeared over the hill.</p>

<p>The scout realized that this hanging talk was all for
the prisoner and his friends, and that the spectacular
manner of Red Dick&#8217;s taking away was also to impress
the men on the opposite side of the river, who were raving
and yelling themselves hoarse in threats at Fighting
Dan.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had seen enough of the big gambler to
know that he would not seriously injure Red Dick, but
had no doubt there would be a near lynching to scare the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Turning back on the trail until dark, the scout and
Cayuse went into camp, deciding to remain until very
early in the morning and then ride for town so as to
reach there early in the day. They had turned in scarcely
more than an hour when they were awakened by hoofbeats
of horses hard pushed. The riders were coming
down river at a stiff gallop and directly at the camp of
the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make um saddle quick,&#8221; said Cayuse, springing up.
&#8220;Him cowboys, Pa-e-has-ka,&#8221; continued the Indian boy.
&#8220;No Injun ride same paleface puncher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s Red Dick&#8217;s men, who have ridden to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
upper ford, and crossed, and are now after Dan and his
crowd,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>The party went thundering by within a few rods, but
did not see Cody and Cayuse. It was the cowboys from
Bozeman, and there could be no mistaking their mission.
They were shouting ribald threats as they rode, each
trying to outdo his comrades in voicing what he would
do to Fighting Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something of an effort to keep up their courage, I
should say,&#8221; remarked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Crows holler loud, all same fly &#8217;way when
eagle come,&#8221; offered Cayuse.</p>

<p>Once more the neighborhood was quiet and our
friends were not disturbed, until just at the break of day
Navi aroused the human branch of the expedition by
a shrill and prolonged neigh.</p>

<p>Cayuse sprang up and approached his pinto to note
the direction the sensitive nostrils were pointed.</p>

<p>When he returned he said, pointing to the west:</p>

<p>&#8220;Injun ponies that way. Mebbyso Crow warriors go
cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we don&#8217;t care for their company, so we
had better canter along ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were about to mount, an Indian pushed
through a clump of willows, rode to within ten feet of
the scout, stoically refraining from word or glance until
he had halted his pony. Then, fixing his piercing eyes
on the scout, the Indian said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What Pa-e-has-ka do here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill looked steadily at the handsome Indian
for a moment, and then answered as he advanced with
extended hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;To help good Indians like White-man-runs-him
against bad palefaces.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&#8220;Ugh! Pa-e-has-ka heap brave paleface. Always
friend of red man. Only one like um&mdash;Old Curly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, chief, the Boy General is a friend of the Indians,
and so is Buffalo Bill. The Great Father at Washington
has sent Pa-e-has-ka here to stop the paleface robbers
from stealing the red man&#8217;s land, blankets, and
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better stop bad palefaces selling fire-water to red
man, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White-man-runs-him speaks well. His words are
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka heap brave and strong. Great Spirit
love Pa-e-has-ka and Old Curly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian turned his pony and rode away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him honest Injun,&#8221; ventured Little Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cayuse; good and brave, and he loves his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Bozeman the first man they saw that morning was
Price. He was apparently in great haste and did not
notice the scout and Little Cayuse. They rode into a
stable, and Cayuse immediately started after Price on
foot, at Buffalo Bill&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>The scout went to the hotel and waited; but he had
hardly seated himself near the window and was preparing
for a good smoke, when a young man hurried in
and asked the clerk for W. F. Cody.</p>

<p>The scout overheard and answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A note for you, sir,&#8221; the young man said.</p>

<p>He handed the scout a sealed envelope and went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
without waiting for a reply or giving Cody an opportunity
to ask questions.</p>

<p>The note read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I am in trouble at the Mason &amp; Moore ranch. Can
you not come to me?</p>

<p class="right">
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, M. D.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It was the signature of the young physician who had
so favorably impressed the scout when he attended
Hickok.</p>

<p>The scout made hurried inquiries and learned that the
Mason &amp; Moore ranch lay thirty miles to the northeast,
up toward Crazy Mountains. He decided to wait until
noon for Cayuse; if the Piute had not arrived at that
time he would go alone.</p>

<p>Cayuse had not returned and at 1 p. m. the scout
ordered Bear Paw saddled, and departed, after leaving
word with the clerk for Little Cayuse when he should
come.</p>

<p>If Price and his men had planned to first separate and
then destroy the band of Uncle Sam&#8217;s workers, their
plans were certainly working to perfection. Skibo and
Nomad were caring for Wild Bill at the abandoned
mine; Buffalo Bill was on a blind errand into a strange
country, while Cayuse had disappeared in the wake of
the chief villain of them all.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill would have had his suspicions aroused
by a message from almost any other person in the town,
but he had formed an opinion of the young physician
that was wholly favorable to the man.</p>

<p>He had left the town an hour behind when two men
set out in the same direction.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill passed a tumble-down hut with slovenly
surroundings, but did not pause. When he had galloped
ten miles beyond he was surprised by the boom of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
heavy guns back in the direction of Bozeman. They
were fired at intervals of about thirty seconds.</p>

<p>The scout wondered what it could mean, for he recognized
the voice of an artillery piece&mdash;it was not a blast,
as the uninitiated might suspect.</p>

<p>At mid-afternoon he was approaching a pass in a
rough section of country, and the trail showed little
usage. The sides of the ravine were broken and precipitous,
while the banks of a small stream along which the
trail ran were thickly clothed in willow. The scout, half
instinctively, looked to his guns, and rode erect and alert
in his saddle.</p>

<p>Somehow those three heavy reports had put a suspicion
in his mind. Bear Paw was nervous. He pranced
along the narrow trail uneasily, with sensitive ears darting
forward and back to catch every sound, and nostrils
breathing a half snort at every breath.</p>

<p>Suddenly the intelligent animal sprang forward so
quickly as to almost unseat a rider who had never been
thrown, and as he did so several rifle shots rang out and
bullets whistled about the head of the scout.</p>

<p>The shots had been fired from both sides of the trail
by men secreted in the dense growth. The nervousness
of the horse had for the moment saved the scout&#8217;s life.
The horse skimmed along the trail like a bird on the
wing as the scout wheeled in the saddle with rifle ready
to greet any who might try for a second shot.</p>

<p>In that position the scout was illy prepared for the
next dastardly move of the men bent on taking his life.</p>

<p>A rope suddenly lifted ahead of the horse. The animal
tripped over it, and plunged headlong down an embankment
where river and trail veered sharply, and its
rider was hurled far over, landing in several feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
muddy water and struggling to the surface half stunned
by the impact.</p>

<p>The horse regained its feet and limped up the bank.
The man swept the water from his eyes, and started to
follow the horse, when four rifles clicked and a hoarse
voice shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say your prayers while I&#8217;m countin&#8217; twenty, Buffalo
Bill, for then you die.&#8221;</p>

<small>OLD NOMAD FINDS EXCITEMENT.</small></h2></div>


<p>After Buffalo Bill and Little Cayuse had left their
pards and the prisoner near the old mine in the mountains,
old Nomad found time hanging heavily on his
hands. He felt just a little hurt that the scout had not
selected him for a companion on this trip instead of the
Piute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Ov all ther tarnation picnics yourn truly
ever stacked up erginst this is ther plumb wust&mdash;jest
leanin&#8217; up ergin er rock fer erbout er month o&#8217; Sundays
ter see &#8217;f ther pesky thing rises er sinks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been propped up here for two hull hours sence
Buffler rode out er sight, an&#8217; I hain&#8217;t so much ez seen er
bird. I&#8217;m gwine ter huntin&#8217; rattlers round this hyar
mounting, an&#8217; see &#8217;f I can&#8217;t stir up some &#8217;xcitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you uneasy, Nomad?&#8221; asked Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, lookahere, pard! D&#8217;yu ever yank er catfish out
on ther sand an&#8217; then watch &#8217;im flop? Waal, whut d&#8217;yu
think erbout his bein&#8217; oneasy an&#8217; lonesome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you and Skibo wrestle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? Who&mdash;Skibo an&#8217; me? Say, Hick, yer jokin&#8217;.
When I wrassles I want a man &#8217;cordin &#8217;ter my strength,
an&#8217; science, an&#8217; good looks. Now, thet thar Skibo, he
ain&#8217;t in my class, noways. He might wrassle with a bull
thet girted &#8217;bout eight feet, but &#8217;f I sh&#8217;d git holt er him
I sh&#8217;d break &#8217;im in two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! Mars&#8217; Hickok, an&#8217; den dar&#8217;d be two niggahs
in de rock pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I&#8217;ll be gumdastercated!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>This exclamation caused the others to look at Nomad,
who was staring, half wildly and half happily, out across
the plain. They followed his gaze and saw three Indians
on ponies just emerging from the thick growth beyond
the lift of a terrace, half a mile to the west.</p>

<p>Another and another followed, until fifteen were in
view, riding eastward in a leisurely manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8217;n ther blue kinks o&#8217; my curly hair, couldn&#8217;t
them thar pesky reds ha&#8217; come this way an&#8217; started
sumthin&#8217;? Sufferin&#8217; wild cats! How my muscles ache,
an&#8217; how my brain itches! Say, Hick, whar d&#8217;yu s&#8217;pose
them pesky redskins air goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell better, Nomad, if I knew what brand of
reds they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, s&#8217;posin&#8217; they&#8217;re Crows, whar they goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;posin&#8217; they&#8217;re Sioux?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they have probably been into mischief or are
looking for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s jest what I nachally concluded&mdash;them thar red
hoss thiefs ain&#8217;t round hyar jest &#8217;cause they&#8217;re prowlin&#8217;,
but &#8217;cause sumbuddy wants um hyar. Now, I figgers
thet they&#8217;ve been sent for by some o&#8217; them Bozeman
scoundrels an&#8217; thet they&#8217;re goin&#8217; up &#8217;mong them buttes
jest below ther town ter wait fer dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s it, Nomad,&#8221; answered the Laramie
man wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Hick; you&#8217;n Skibo &#8217;r&#8217; all right; I believe I&#8217;ll
git Hide-rack an&#8217; sashay over thet way, an&#8217; see what I
can diskiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t get into trouble till Cody comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I won&#8217;t. Hick,&#8221; promised Nomad, in childish
glee at being able to get away so easily.</p>

<p>Nomad&#8217;s evident pleasure at the prospect of some sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of excitement was a relief to Hickok, who, as well as he
liked the veteran trapper, tired of the latter&#8217;s fretting if
in any way restrained.</p>

<p>Old Nomad put spurs to Hide-rack, and tore across
the little plain as though his life depended upon overtaking
the party of Indians, when, in fact, he did not
intend to come in contact with them at all, or even to
have them see him. In this he blundered.</p>

<p>Half an hour after leaving his companions among the
hills, Nomad rounded a rift of rock and came into a
little vale thickly grown with willows. He leaned over
his horse&#8217;s neck to scrutinize the signs of the passing
party of Indians as he entered the growth, and then felt
himself suddenly jerked from the saddle to land sprawling
on his back, and a couple of brawny Indians held
him there and proceeded to bind him, as Nomad expressed
it&mdash;&#8220;hoof an&#8217; tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howlin&#8217; heifercats!&#8221; shouted Nomad, as he struggled
with his captors. &#8220;What d&#8217;yu red mummies reckon you&#8217;d
hitched onter, anyhow? Guess you don&#8217;t know ole
Nomad, du ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was grunted out disjointedly as the trapper
wrenched and fought with his captors.</p>

<p>&#8220;By ther great horn spoon an&#8217; er dozen little ladles,
I&#8217;ll wring ther dirty necks ov nine er &#8217;leven o&#8217; yer pesky
heifercats!&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad was wasting his breath and strength, for
in spite of the terrific fight he put up the two braves
gradually overpowered him, and he was finally helpless,
with hands and feet in the firmly knotted loops of a
lariat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted one of them. &#8220;Heap hard nut to
crack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer hain&#8217;t got &#8217;im cracked yit, nuther, yer red loafer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll be fishin&#8217; in ther Yallerstun when yore great gran&#8217;-childern
be er chasin&#8217; ghosts er foxes in ther happy
huntin&#8217; groun&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big tongue; many wiggle!&#8221; said the other Indian
solemnly.</p>

<p>Nomad strained savagely at his bonds in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand any more o&#8217; yer sass, ye b&#8217;iled apology
fer a decent heathen. Take off this rawhide, an&#8217; gi&#8217; me
a chance at both o&#8217; ye, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll knock ye inter sixteen
kinds o&#8217; cocked hats in jest erbout &#8217;leven shakes ov er
little lamb&#8217;s last piece o&#8217; mutton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other Indians came, and the trapper at least realized
that he was a prisoner, and that in spite of his taunting
he could not draw from them why he had been thus
treated or who had ordered these indignities.</p>

<p>The trapper was placed under guard, and passed a
weary day, while all the Indians but the one who sat
smoking with a rifle across his knees departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that beat ole split-huff hisself?&#8221; mourned
Nomad, as he saw the redskins depart. &#8220;Only that pesky
cigar sign stuck up thar on er rock ter &#8217;muse myself
with. Hey, Indian! Why don&#8217;t yer say suthin&#8217; er do
suthin&#8217; ter keep comp&#8217;ny from gittin&#8217; homesick? Say,
yer red-skinned mummy, I&#8217;ll give yer the fust shot if
you&#8217;ll come inter a game ov take turns as er target.&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What yer say, red, do ut? Aw! Ye wooden head,
why don&#8217;t ye grunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad subsided again. He was disgusted with himself
and everybody else. He had started out to hunt
excitement, and here he was with nothing to do and no
prospect of anything happening right away. It was
worse than watching over Hickok and the prisoner&mdash;then
he could smoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>But early in the evening the Indians returned and
with them a white man. The latter kept beyond the
range of Nomad&#8217;s vision in the bushes, except for occasional
glimpses as the party moved about.</p>

<p>After a long confab with the Indians, the white man,
with a handkerchief tied over the lower part of his face,
came for a look at the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uv all ther white-faced heifercats! I&#8217;d give er nine-dollar
bill ter git er paw on ye, ye white-livered coyote.
Yer too low ter &#8217;sociate with ther meanest redskin this
side ther river Styx. Say, if you&#8217;ll cut this hyar rope
I&#8217;ll fix yer in er minyit so&#8217;s you wouldn&#8217;t know yerself&mdash;&#8217;thout
any rag tied over yer face.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow made no reply, but said loud enough so
that Nomad could hear:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t Buffalo Bill, but he&#8217;s one of the gang;
dispose of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haw! haw! haw! Ther reds took me fer Buffler!
Waal, thet sets me up some &#8217;f not more. Guess Buffler&#8217;d
feel complermented. I suttinly hopes I live long ernough
ter tell that to &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<small>LITTLE CAYUSE CAPTURED.</small></h2></div>


<p>Ominously the words sounded in the hush that followed
the pronunciation of the death sentence on Buffalo
Bill&mdash;&#8220;One, two, three!&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout had been dazed by the long flight through
the air and impact with the water. He scarcely realized
the import of the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four, five, six!&#8221; the counting continued slowly, while
the arms of four men settled into rigidity, holding four
frowning rifle muzzles on the human target.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven, eight, nine!&#8221; the counting went on relentlessly,
while four checks settled more firmly on the rifle
stocks and four eyes gleamed along the shining steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten, eleven, twelve!&#8221; and the scout had begun to
understand the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing waist-deep in the muddy water, the scout
suddenly realized that four shining rifles were aimed at
his heart, and a sonorous voice was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two seconds more and those leaden messengers would
pierce his body.</p>

<p>In his hazy struggle to reclaim his mind the scout had
dropped his hands helplessly into the water at his sides.
Now both came up suddenly, sending a shower, and at
the same instant he threw himself sidewise with a great
splash.</p>

<p>Four rifles cracked as one, and as many bullets cut the
spray where the scout had stood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>The marksmen had been startled and confused by the
man&oelig;uvre, and blazed away together at the spot they
were holding on. But the scout was not there, and before
they had recovered from their surprise he was
bounding up the bank like a deer.</p>

<p>Two other shots went wild, and then Buffalo Bill&#8217;s revolvers
got busy from somewhere in the underbrush
along the bank, and the four riflemen and the one who
had pronounced the death sentence ducked for cover.</p>

<p>In spite of their wetting the scout&#8217;s revolvers were in
working condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;One! two! three!&#8221; he shouted, sending as many bullets
into the bushes after the tumbling, panicky thugs,
who had heard Buffalo Bill&#8217;s reputation as a shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Bear Paw, lively now!&#8221; called the scout to his
horse, as he darted into a dense thicket. The intelligent
animal hastened after his master.</p>

<p>As the scout was swinging into the saddle an Indian
appeared before him and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Pa-e-has-ka.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout recognized White-man-runs-him, the
friendly trailer who was destined, within a few months,
to play a prominent part in one of the most thrilling
dramas in the history of conflicts with American Indians.</p>

<p>The Indian sprang across a little open space, with
Bear Paw at his heels. After many devious turns and
man&oelig;uvres among the rocks the Indian emerged upon
the plain and pointed a little to the south of the setting
sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bozeman is there; white bad men here; Pa-e-has-ka
have care.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout reached his hand, and for a moment solemnly
clasped that of the red brother; then, pulling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
beautiful pearl-handled hunting knife from his own belt,
he passed it hilt foremost to the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never soil it with innocent blood, brother,&#8221; he said,
and rode away.</p>

<p>The Indian stood with the handsome knife in his hand,
looking first at it and then after the figure of a horseman
that was rapidly disappearing in the swiftly falling
night.</p>

<p>If the red lips formed a vow there was none to hear,
but in swiftly following events that knife figured, and
was in the famous battle in which General Custer and
nearly three hundred brave men fell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little Cayuse had no difficulty in keeping the rascally
Price in sight, and when the latter entered a lonely cabin
on the outskirts of the town the Piute was not far away.
He saw from safe concealment another man come out
and peer intently about, as if fearing eavesdroppers, and
then pass around the cabin to discover if any person
might be hiding in the shadows near by.</p>

<p>Then, before the fellow had barely closed the door,
the silent moccasins of Little Cayuse had covered the
distance to the hut, and their owner was searching the
walls for crack or crevice by which he could see and
hear what was going on within. The search was unrewarded,
and Cayuse sought other means.</p>

<p>Near the hut was an overgrown, much-tangled willow,
which reached out as if to embrace this little habitation
of man. Cayuse allowed an &#8220;Ugh!&#8221; of satisfaction to
escape him as he swung into the tree with the agility of
a monkey.</p>

<p>Out on the largest branch which overhung the roof of
the shanty, the Indian youth crept, and was soon perched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
alongside a hole at the back of the wide stone chimney.
From this position he could look into the single room below
through the big fireplace in which no fire had been
lighted. By leaning far forward with his head in the
chimney, he could hear distinctly the words of the men.</p>

<p>There were four besides Price in the cabin, and at
times each passed near enough to the chimney flue so
that Cayuse obtained a good view of their features.</p>

<p>The five men finally sat around a rough table and got
down to business. Price was the first to broach the all-important
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sawyer; what&#8217;s the word from Washington?
You say you were ordered here in haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going all along the line to Oregon to put the
boys on their guard and to tell them what we have
learned of conditions in the Indian reservations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose we know conditions on the reservations
as well as you do in Washington?&#8221; asked Price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you give your time to gambling and drinking
poor rum,&#8221; Sawyer answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;re you shooting at? I don&#8217;t do either one to any
extent that hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you did, but somebody is doing it, and is
not contented with a fair thing, but is robbing the Indians
so barefacedly that there is going to be an uprising.
Then, too, things are being carried on so boldly
and openly that the government is getting wise to the
&#8216;ring,&#8217; and there is no telling when the axe will fall in
high places in Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always whining at Washington about its fellows
out here. We do the dirty work and take all the
kicks, and you fellows gobble all the proceeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know better than that, Price. As near as I can
find out you are salting away more plunder than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
other along the line. We give you credit for organizing
county officials and courts, but you ought to manage to
let the reds have enough to keep them fairly contented
or do something to pacify them. The devil is to pay
now. Sitting Bull has declined to sign a treaty giving
up any more lands, and he refuses to agree to remain
upon a reservation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the government teach him a lesson, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good sight easier said than done, Price;
and, then, again, what is to become of your occupation
and mine if we have a war with the Sioux? The Bad
Lands are swarming with Sioux warriors now. Sitting
Bull is the most powerful Indian in America, and in case
of a government movement against them there will be a
good deal of blood shed, and the country will demand an
investigation of the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know so much about Sitting Bull and his
warriors in the Bad Lands? We haven&#8217;t heard anything
about it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just the trouble, Price. You fellows out here
don&#8217;t attempt to keep track of things. Small bands of
reds are making their way down the Gallatin Valley every
day, and because they don&#8217;t come yelling and shooting
into town you think they are a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;For months the department has been attempting to
soothe the feelings of the Sioux, while Cody, Custer,
Crook, Gibbon, and Terry have been making a study of
the situation. Their reports are filed in Washington, and
matters are looking serious. Cody is in this territory,
somewhere, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have my trap all set, and Mr. Buffalo Bill
will soon come up among the missing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;Now, look here, Price. I believe you are determined
to wreck the whole business. You speak of putting Buffalo
Bill out of the way as if it were as easy as the killing
of a yellow dog. Why don&#8217;t you let up and keep quiet
while he is in this part of the country, instead of getting
in deeper by trying to beat a better man than you at his
own game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sawyer, I like your nerve. You talk to me as
if I was a boy of about fifteen. Do you suppose I am
playing any ordinary hand of cards against Cody? If
you do you are mistaken; but I said he is soon to drop
out of the counting, and he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Price; when I get back at the capital, I&#8217;ll
tell them where you went to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that when you spring your trap you will find
you are the one who is in it, and Buffalo Bill will be
looking for other easy game.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his zeal to learn all with reference to Pa-e-has-ka,
Little Cayuse had climbed up the tree and out upon another
limb, intending to quietly reach the roof and hunt
for some means of entering the cabin. As it happened,
however, the branch slipped from under him, and he
dropped upon the roof with a thud, crashing through the
flimsy covering and landing on a few loose boards that
separated the loft from the lower room in which the men
were seated.</p>

<p>There was no escape. He was in plain view of the
heavily armed men below, and surrender was the only
course open. In five minutes Cayuse was a prisoner and
under guard by the demand of Sawyer, who countermanded
Price&#8217;s order that the Piute be shot at once.
Price told Sawyer that Cayuse was a trailer for Buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Bill and already knew too much, but the man from
Washington, in spite of his dishonest calling, realized
that the very violence of the methods of the &#8220;ring&#8221; would
prove to be its own executioner. There were far too
many such men as Price and his followers.</p>

<small>THE DYNAMITER AGAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill reached the hotel at Bozeman late that
night, and learned that Little Cayuse had not returned.
He also, by careful inquiry, discovered that the doctor
was in Virginia City.</p>

<p>After a brief halt for food and rest for himself and
horse, the scout pushed on to the mountains southward,
for he was anxious regarding Wild Bill&#8217;s condition, and
he half hoped that Little Cayuse had returned there.</p>

<p>It was halfway from midnight to daylight when the
scout was challenged by the stern:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt, dar! Who be yeh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Skibo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul; it&#8217;s Mars&#8217; Billyum hisse&#8217;f! We&#8217;s
pow&#8217;ful glad, too, Mars&#8217; Billyum; dat&#8217;s what we is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is going wrong, Skibo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eberyting jes nachally gone to de debil, Mars&#8217;
Billyum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Skibo; is Hickok worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but he&#8217;s so mad he jes&#8217; can&#8217;t hol&#8217; him skin ober
&#8217;is bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, what is it all about, Skibo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In de fust place, Nomad he done git oneasy, an&#8217; jes&#8217;
nachally couldn&#8217;t stan&#8217; it. So he done mount Hide-rack
an&#8217; slide out, an&#8217; we hain&#8217;t seen him no mo&#8217;. Den, jes&#8217;
&#8217;fore midnight dat measly pris&#8217;ner wiggle outen his rope
an&#8217; skedaddle. Mars&#8217; Hickok done discober &#8217;im jes&#8217; in
time to wing &#8217;im. But &#8217;e got erway, swearin&#8217; awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cayuse hasn&#8217;t, returned?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;No, sah; we hain&#8217;t seen &#8217;im sence yo&#8217; an&#8217; he went
away dat mawnin&#8217;, Mars&#8217; Billyum.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were approaching the little shelter where the
Laramie man had lain during his convalescence, and
found the latter in no pleasant mood.</p>

<p>Hickok related the story of Bloody Ike&#8217;s escape, and
told how old Nomad had gone away, promising to return
in a short time.</p>

<p>Hickok&#8217;s condition was so much improved that he
proposed to ride into town that morning, but the scout
advised against it.</p>

<p>The scout himself was worn out from his wearying
work of the last forty-eight hours and scanty opportunities
for rest. He decided to sleep for a few hours,
and then set out in search of Nomad and Cayuse.</p>

<p>Hickok remained on guard, and with the first streak
of light was scanning the plains, hoping for a glimpse
of the fleeing Bloody Ike; but if that worthy had left the
hills he had reached town during the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Before setting out in the morning Buffalo Bill got all
the particulars of Nomad&#8217;s departure and where he was
last seen to disappear behind the table-land near the town.
The scout cautioned Hickok and Skibo to be constantly
on guard against their late prisoner. He feared that
Bloody Ike had not left the hills and would attempt some
sort of vengeance. So Cody cautioned them to keep well
behind the rocks where Ike could not pick them off from
a distance with a rifle and to be ready for an attempted
bomb throwing. The scout knew that the former boss of
mine explosives would welcome the opportunity to blow
them all into eternity.</p>

<p>The scout readily found the place where old Nomad
had met the enemy and guessed that the trapper had
been ambushed and overpowered there. But he saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
blood, and decided that Nick had been made a prisoner
and was perhaps somewhere in the vicinity now, under
guard.</p>

<p>As he studied his surroundings he heard the shrill
neigh of a horse. Bear Paw threw up his head, and
would have answered, but the scout clapped a hand over
his horse&#8217;s nose. He then slipped on a muzzle he had
used before, and, leading Bear Paw into a dense thicket,
hitched him there, and began further investigation on
foot.</p>

<p>Once more the whinny of a horse reached him, and the
scout had no doubt it must be Hide-rack. He knew it
was not the call of an Indian pony.</p>

<p>At last he gently pushed aside the thick foliage and
peered into a little clearing where Hide-rack was alternately
feeding and sniffing the air in the direction of
the place where Bear Paw was tethered.</p>

<p>Carefully scanning the little opening, the scout saw
that a few rods beyond was another, farther in among
the rocks. Keeping to the thickest part of the growth,
he skirted the first opening, and approached the other.
And then Cody heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, ye pizen red helgominian heifercat, why don&#8217;t
ye do suthin&#8217;? Ye set thar an&#8217; smok&#8217; yerself black in
ther face an&#8217; never offer me er pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout peeped out and saw his pard trussed up
like a pig for market, while near him sat a solitary
guard, pulling at a red clay pipe.</p>

<p>The Indian was as motionless and silent as a statue as
Nomad kept up his tirade of abuse. Buffalo Bill noiselessly
left the cover and approached the Indian&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>Old Nomad saw and understood. He increased his
torrent of invective to cover the noise of a possible slip
of Pa-e-has-ka&#8217;s moccasin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>But there was no discovery until the scout&#8217;s sinewy
hand slipped around the Indian&#8217;s throat, and the silent
struggle was soon ended.</p>

<p>The redskin was unharmed, but bound firmly, then
gagged, and left in the place lately occupied by the trapper.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill asked the Indian if his companions would
return at night, and received an affirmative nod, so he
and Nomad rode away to the hills again.</p>

<p>That night the scout himself remained on guard and
sent Nomad, Hickok, and Skibo to rest. Cody was
somewhat anxious regarding Little Cayuse, and he felt
confident that Bloody Ike was still in that region and
would attempt some sort of an attack on the party.</p>

<p>The shelter of brush and blankets was in a thicket of
stunted willow, which grew on a sort of stair of the
mountain. Ten rods away was an entrance to the abandoned
mine. Along one side and four or five rods away
was a fall of sixty or seventy feet. On the other side
and not more than three rods from camp was another
&#8220;rise&#8221; of thirty to fifty feet.</p>

<p>The scout had cautioned his pards to stick close to the
thicket, in which were great blocks of rocks in uneven,
toppling piles. Here they were comparatively safe from
the bullets of a lurking enemy on the heights above. The
scout believed that Bloody Ike knew every turn of the
old mine, and as a hiding place it could hardly have an
equal. A man with guns and ammunition could defy an
army. He could bob up in unexpected places and pick
off a man and then disappear.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark the scout stole out of camp
and climbed to a good position upon the rocks above.
There he lighted his pipe and settled down to a solitary
vigil. In the shadow of a clump of bushes he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be seen, while he commanded a view of the moonlit
rocks all about him, and from where he sat he could see
both entrances to the old mine.</p>

<p>The scout turned over in his mind the incidents of the
last few days, and wondered at the rapidity of developments.
He was opposing a well-organized gang, as
every incident indicated. In the attempt to decoy him to
his death the villains had made use of a small cannon as
a signal. There were not only white rascals in the gang,
but they had enlisted the services of various bands of Indians
such as the one which had captured Nomad. The
members of the gang, or at least some of them, placed
no value on human existence. A man&#8217;s life would be
taken with as little compunction as that caused by the
killing of a snake or a rat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name of common sense is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s muttered exclamation had been called
forth by something which came into view on the bare,
flat top of the mountain beyond and above the upper entrance
to the mine.</p>

<p>It was a gray object, the very color of the rock along
which it moved noiselessly, and could not have been distinguished
had it not been outlined against the sky beyond.</p>

<p>The thing was moving toward the edge of the descent
very slowly, as though having no object in life whatever.</p>

<p>It was a shapeless mass, anyway, or seemed to be,
perhaps distorted by the moonlight and its own shadow.
From all the scout could make out it might be a small
haystack or a cord of wood out for a ramble.</p>

<p>With rifle ready, for the scout was suspicious of this
peculiarity, he watched the thing approach the very edge
of the precipice and pause. There it rested, minute after
minute, as motionless as the rock itself, until the scout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
began to wonder if it had not all been an optical illusion,
and that he had been glaring at a great bowlder perched
on the brink of the abyss.</p>

<p>The scout rubbed his eyes, glanced away for a moment,
and then looked back.</p>

<p>Again he was surprised into a smothered exclamation.</p>

<p>The thing had grown a head. But its head was in
proportion to its size as that of a turtle. And it had
grown out of the flat top of the body&mdash;it was still growing.</p>

<p>The head was followed by a pair of human shoulders,
and then an arm was raised aloft, and in the hand was
an object plainly outlined against the sky.</p>

<p>It was the head, shoulders, and arms of a man, and the
arm was about to hurl something into the bushes far below.</p>

<p>Like lightning the scout&#8217;s rifle went into position, and
just as the arm launched its missile there was a sharp
crack, followed instantly by a thunderous roar and blinding
flash at the crest of the mountain.</p>

<p>When the smoke had cleared away and the scout&#8217;s
eyes became accustomed to the moonlight again, he saw
that the strange craft of the clifftop had been wrecked.
And out of the wreck an animated object was moving
along the bare rock. Then the moving thing sprang into
a human form and ran along the rocks for a short distance
to disappear where the strange object had first appeared
to the scout.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had again raised his rifle, but lowered it
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess Bloody Ike got a surprise party that time,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Down below old Nomad sang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are ye all right, Buffler?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Yes; go to sleep again. I don&#8217;t think you will be
disturbed again to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout climbed to the top of the rock and examined
the wreck. It had been a hogshead heavily padded
with cotton waste and blankets in an attempt at bullet-proof
construction. Holes in the ends had been sawn
out below for the feet of the occupant and in the top for
a peep hole, and from which to shoot or hurl missiles.</p>

<p>Bloody Ike had attempted to throw a bomb into the
camp of his enemies, and Buffalo Bill&#8217;s bullet had caught
it just as it left the rascal&#8217;s hand. The explosion had
destroyed the bullet-proof craft.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF THE MOUNTAINTOP.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Price&#8217;s henchmen brought back word that Buffalo
Bill had slipped out of their trap, and made good his
escape, and they could not tell in what direction, that
worthy was in a savage state of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you drop &#8217;im from the saddle without any
warning when he went by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We tried it, but his horse jumped just as we pulled,
and then ran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where was your trip rope that we planned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That worked to perfection and threw the horse.
Long Hair plunged into the water, but was out again before
we got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men did not tell Price of the counting incident,
and the sensational way in which Buffalo Bill had drawn
their fire, and then scared them into the wood with a
few shots of his own.</p>

<p>Price was in a rage and asked for Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the only one of you to be depended on, and
he can&#8217;t seem to do the thing right,&#8221; he stormed.</p>

<p>Then the leader went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil is to pay. The Washington end has sent
a man on here to shut us off, and wants us to keep dark
for a time until the excitement blows over. But we can&#8217;t
shut down until we get rid of Cody and his band. They
know altogether too much, and we&#8217;ve got to get rid of
them before we can keep dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;We captured an Indian boy last night that was spying
on us at the hide-out. He is here to trail the Indians for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Buffalo Bill, he told us, and I scared him into telling us
a lot of Cody&#8217;s plans. So now if we don&#8217;t settle Mr. Buffalo
Bill&#8217;s hash we&#8217;re a poor lot of tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Indian boy says Buffalo Bill has a hiding place
near the upper ford on the Gallatin River, and I made him
describe the country around there to see if he was lying.
He told us of seeing Fighting Dan capture Red Dick
and how many men each side had. He says Buffalo
Bill has ten men with him, and they are going to meet
here next week, if they don&#8217;t change plans because he is
missing. Now, my opinion is that Cody will be in Bozeman
within a day or two hunting for the Indian kid,
and then is the time we must fix him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to do it?&#8221; one of the men asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you fellows to cut loose and find Ike for me.
He can do the job if we can locate the place where Cody
stops when he comes to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that other job was easy, but why didn&#8217;t you fellows
make good? Now, get busy, and keep your eyes
peeled for Buffalo Bill or any of his men, and report to
headquarters at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do with the Indian?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the cellar out at the hide-out. We are going
to turn him over to Ten Rattles and his red cutthroats.
They&#8217;ll take him up the Yellowstone and &#8216;lose&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Cayuse was indeed in the cellar of the hut where
he had played eavesdropper and had dropped through
the roof. The shrewd Piute had pretended to be badly
scared, and had told a rambling story of what Pa-e-has-ka
had planned to do and where he was now and
would be in the future, every word of it misleading.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse had taken this part upon himself, hoping
Price might think he would be useful to them later and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
would leave an opportunity for the Piute to learn something
more of their plans.</p>

<p>The Indian youth was willing to undergo any hardship
if he believed he was serving Pa-e-has-ka. He had
faith that he could escape when the proper time should
arrive, and contented himself with putting Price on the
wrong trail.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Hickok reached the Willow Inn next
day, and half an hour later Price was in possession of
the news. For reasons of his own Buffalo Bill had divided
his forces. Old Nomad and Skibo had moved to
another part of the range, a less exposed position which
commanded a view of the entire mountaintop, and yet
unapproachable except from one direction. Here one
man could remain on guard while the other slept and
safely await the orders of the scout. At the same time
they might learn more of Bloody Ike and his retreat.</p>

<p>When Price heard that Cody had arrived in town his
first question was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a man at the hotel we can trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; Fatty Joe is meat cook, an&#8217; Miles Doughty is
clerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send Doughty over here as soon as he can come,
without arousing suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave lounged into the hotel, bought a drink, loafed
around for a time, spoke for a moment with the clerk,
bought another drink, and went away. Shortly after the
clerk went out and walked directly to Price&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>As history records what transpired, we are permitted
to follow the plot. Price said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Doughty; I sent for you on important business,
but first I must ask if you can be relied on for a
little deal that will net you a hundred or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;Do you know that Buffalo Bill and one of his partners
are at your house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mistrusted as much, for I had heard they were in
this part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they are the chaps, all right enough, and they
are here for a purpose. They intend to spoil the business
of this whole section, pretending they are friends of
the Indians. You know in the East they are working up
a lot of sympathy for the redskins, and this Cody is
playing a high hand for politics. He thinks he is going
to be President sometime. Now, we want to get him out
of the way in the quietest manner possible. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you locked up tight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As mum as a clam in freezing weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, here it is: If you can manage to get those
fellows drugged, we&#8217;ll take them away and keep them
out of sight&mdash;and pay you well for your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I get them drugged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough. Couldn&#8217;t Fatty Joe fix their food?
You know Horsey Al can fix up dope to lay out anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have to see Fatty. I think he&#8217;d go into it if there
isn&#8217;t to be any real killing. You know he is hiding from
a record in the East, and he doesn&#8217;t want to do anything
shady for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him he needn&#8217;t worry any about the killing&mdash;we&#8217;ll
take them away to a safe place and keep them a
while, and then if the weather gets too thick we&#8217;ll cut
them loose and skedaddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Well, I&#8217;ll have to talk it over with Fatty, so
I&#8217;ll be going, but I&#8217;ll let you know to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Price had adopted another scheme because Bloody Ike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
seemed to have vanished since the night the hotel was
blown up. He would have their food drugged, and if
the dose proved fatal so much the better. &#8220;Horsey Al,&#8221;
a local horse doctor of shady reputation, had suggested
the plot and guaranteed to &#8220;lay out&#8221; the man who swallowed
his &#8220;medicine,&#8221; and he said he could prepare it so
no one could distinguish any peculiarity in the taste of
food with which it was mixed.</p>

<p>It seemed the best plot thus far, and Price became
quite enthusiastic. The Willow Inn was a large, low,
rambling structure that was almost surrounded by trees
and shrubbery. In no place was the building more than
two stories high, and from any of the windows a drugged
man could be removed in the night without discovery or
causing suspicion.</p>

<p>If the victims were &#8220;doped&#8221; at their evening meal,
they could be taken away in the early part of the night,
and securely hidden before daylight, and every man
taking part in it back in town as usual next day.</p>

<p>To detail the carrying out of the plot would occupy
space and time, so we will jump to the period where
Fatty Joe had followed instructions in the use of a
package from Horsey Al, and had served the orders of
Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill that night, the food heavily
laden with a powerful drug.</p>

<p>Both men were hungry, and ate heartily, then went to
their room for a smoke, planning later in the night to
slip out of their window and look about town a bit for
the missing Cayuse.</p>

<p>But an overpowering drowsiness caught them and held
them to their chairs, where Price and his knaves found
them an hour later, when they were admitted by the
clerk.</p>

<p>Both men were bound and rebound and heavy towels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tied over their mouths to guard against any slip if the
victims regained their senses.</p>

<p>In this condition Buffalo Bill and his famous pard
were taken from a rear window in the darkness, lashed
to horses, and carried away into the night.</p>

<p>Price and his gang were jubilant. They had the great
scout in their power, and declared among themselves
that his career was ended. Now their work could go on,
they said, for his pards would soon forsake the trail
without his leadership.</p>

<p>At the hut in the outskirts that day Price and his men
celebrated the event of Buffalo Bill&#8217;s capture. They
drank much liquor and renewed their fealty in multiple
oaths and rejoicings. Then they brought out Little
Cayuse, and taunted him with his master&#8217;s helplessness.</p>

<p>Cayuse was in a panic at first when he heard that Pa-e-has-ka
had been captured and carried away to some hiding
place in the hills. But he kept his ears wide, and
after the liquor had flowed freely for a time valuable
information also leaked. Cayuse learned that Pa-e-has-ka
and Hickok were under guard in the old mine.
He also learned that a large consignment of blankets
for the Indians had found its way to the mine and was
stored there, to be peddled out as opportunity offered to
miners and ranchmen.</p>

<p>And among other things which Cayuse picked up that
day was the knowledge that large bands of Sioux were
marching southward, where they were massing in the
Bad Lands. A messenger had come from the region of
the Big Horn ca√±on and reported thousands of Sioux in
that locality. All were in their war paint, and they were
under the orders of Sitting Bull. Chiefs Gall and Rain-in-the-face
were there.</p>

<p>Price and his followers decided to move their principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
effects to the mountain stronghold, where they could
defy white men or Indians if they were driven to the
wall. They would commence at once to store food,
liquor, and ammunition, and keep a strong guard posted.
Horses, too, were necessary, with hay and grain for
them. If the government had a war with the Indians,
when it was over business of all kinds would be booming
in that part of the country, and the thousands of
blankets now on hand would be worth good money.</p>

<p>Late in the day several of the men were laid away to
sleep off their celebration. Price went back to town,
and those left in charge were none too sure of themselves.</p>

<p>Cayuse thought it was the proper occasion to part company
with the crowd, and went about it methodically.
He had discovered before this that he could readily release
his hands, which were bound with a horsehide
lariat. In one corner of the cellar was a place where
water filtered through from a sink drain. In this Cayuse
held his hands and wrists until the horsehide was thoroughly
soaked. He then, by standing on the thongs,
stretched the hide until he could pull out one of his
hands.</p>

<p>It was a simple matter to remove the rest of his lashings,
but not so easy to escape from the cellar and building.
Above, in the only room, were eight men, five of
them drunk, to be sure, but three with sufficient sense
left to realize what the occasion called for if the prisoner
attempted to walk away. There were no windows opening
out of the cellar.</p>

<p>The stairway was narrow, and a ladder served as a
means of entering and leaving the underground apartment.
This ladderway was behind the cook stove and
wood box.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>As soon as dark Cayuse crept up and peeped under
the stove into the room, which was dimly lighted by a
lantern. Six men were snoring in various positions on
floor and stools, and two were smoking and talking, their
conversation dealing principally with their compadres,
who, they said, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t stand any liquor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse studied the situation, fixing in his mind the exact
positions of the men about the room. He was about
to undertake a desperate chance. He went back to the
cellar and secured several round, smooth stones. Then
he crept back up the ladder again, and listened to the
senseless mumbling of the two men who thought they
were not drunk.</p>

<p>Poising himself carefully where he could see past the
wood box, Cayuse hurled one of the stones with unerring
aim at the lantern. With a crash the glass flew in a
thousand pieces, and the cabin was instantly in utter
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whash &#8217;at?&#8221; demanded one of the half-sober men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lan&#8217;n &#8217;xploded,&#8221; explained the other, with remarkable
sang-froid.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Xtror&#8217;nary!&#8221; said the first. &#8220;Musht been too full,
shame&#8217;s shum theshe other fellers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; draught, cosh chimney too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesh; &#8217;twash sho many dra&#8217;f&#8217;s made theshe fellersh
hot, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse crept across the floor, while the guards discussed
the cause and effect of the explosion and fumbled
for matches.</p>

<p>The door was not fastened, and he let himself outside
noiselessly. Then he changed his mind and returned.</p>

<p>The guards were still talking to each other and hunting
for matches. Cayuse believed they, too, would soon
be in drunken slumber. He had determined to arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
himself. They had taken his rifle, also the belt with his
revolver and knife, but his precious medicine bag was
safe inside his shirt.</p>

<p>Cayuse had noted in the dim light that several rifles
and belts were hanging on the wall, but he had not been
able to distinguish his own. Now, climbing over the unconscious
forms of the outlaws and expecting every moment
to see the glare of a match that would reveal him
to the enemy, he felt deftly and rapidly along the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have &#8217;m now,&#8221; chortled one, as he banged against
the stove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mashes al&#8217;sh over here by shtove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lookoush not drop &#8217;m in wood box, shet housh
&#8217;fire,&#8221; cautioned the other, blundering along until he, too,
collided with the stove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heresh be!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exultant exclamation was immediately followed by
a crash, bumpety-bump-bump, then groans and swearing
from the lower regions.</p>

<p>One of the men had fallen down into the cellar.</p>

<p>If Cayuse had been of any other race he would most
probably have laughed at the comical side of the situation.
But Cayuse was busy carrying out rifles, belts, revolvers,
knives, and ammunition.</p>

<p>He had found his own outfit, and now he proposed
to disarm those who would be most likely to follow him.
He carried the arms into a thicket near by, and buried
them in brush and leaves, keeping out several of the best
revolvers. He thought these might be needed by Buffalo
Bill and his pards. Cayuse also carried away all the cartridges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Heap fool palefaces; drink rum and steal!&#8221;
The Piute thus summed up his opinion of the gang that
had accidentally captured him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Little Cayuse had determined that his first work should
be the release of Pa-e-has-ka and Wild Bill. He had understood
that they were under guard in an abandoned
mine, and he had no doubt that it was the mine where
Bloody Ike had taken refuge. He knew, too, that Skibo
and old Nomad were in the mountains, and he hoped to
find them before morning.</p>

<p>Cayuse thought of his loved Navi, but the little pinto
had been left at the hotel stables, and the Piute did not
believe any one would dare remove him. The penalty
for horse stealing in that part of the country was greater
than for killing a man, red or white.</p>

<p>The Piute pard of Pa-e-has-ka decided to make the
trip on foot, and set off at the easy lope of the Indian,
and with the instinct of a homing pigeon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hol&#8217; on dar, ye red-an&#8217;-yeller debil, er Ah&#8217;ll be &#8217;bliged
ter send some sinkers ober &#8217;mong yer ribs,&#8221; explained
a voice, after he had been one hour on the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Heap fool, Skibo; don&#8217;t know Cayuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bress mah soul, if it ain&#8217; de little red pard hisse&#8217;f!&#8221;
and Skibo grasped Cayuse&#8217;s hand in a grip that threatened
to crush it. The darky insisted on waking up old
Nomad to tell him the news, and the veteran trapper
was as warm in his greeting as Skibo had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, by ther &#8217;leven-foot horns ov ther old Obadiah!
Look et thet thar walkin&#8217; arsenal! Whar ye
been, Cayuse, ter pick up thet conglomeration o&#8217; pepper
boxes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse briefly related his story and what he had
learned of Pa-e-has-ka and Hickok.</p>

<p>Old Nomad was in a frenzy of rage and determination
to buckle on his guns and dash into the mine shooting
right and left.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Skibo was helpless in his lack of grasp of such a situation.
He had no idea of the best method of procedure.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse argued long and earnestly with Nomad.</p>

<p>The Indian boy wished to undertake the investigation
of the mine alone. He felt sure that he could discover
more in his own way, by stealthily entering and exploring
the mine, than the three could do with the unavoidable
noise which they would make.</p>

<p>At last old Nomad consented to remain behind, with
the understanding that if Cayuse got into trouble or
needed help he should give the signal known only among
the pards and never described aloud. Then Nomad and
Skibo would dash to the rescue and bombard the place.</p>

<p>At last the details were settled, and shortly after midnight
the Indian youth crept into the upper mouth of the
abandoned mine with the tread of a cougar, and the investigation
of the retreat of Price and his gang had begun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>MATTERS BECOMING COMPLICATED.</small></h2></div>


<p>At the place where the inclines from the upper and
lower levels of the old mine met, was massed along the
timbered walls a strange assortment of plunder gathered
by Price and his gang during many months. Here it
was that Buffalo Bill and the Laramie man, still unconscious,
were taken. And there it was that Price&#8217;s men
found Bloody Ike. The latter was badly injured. He
gloated in the capture of the scout and his pard, and
promised, with extravagant delight, to be the death of
them.</p>

<p>Ike believed his own injuries due to Buffalo Bill, but
he could not understand how it had all come about. The
bomb he had prepared to destroy the camp of the scout
had exploded just after leaving his hand, and he had
narrowly escaped death. He had not distinguished the
scout&#8217;s rifle shot from the explosion which followed, but
he felt that in some way Buffalo Bill had once more defeated
him.</p>

<p>Bloody Ike declared that the pair should never leave
the shaft alive, whether Price so ordered or not. Two
men besides Ike were left to guard the prisoners. The
others went back to partake of the celebration on the following
day, and we have seen that they carried out their
plans.</p>

<p>Price was not told that Little Cayuse had escaped.
Two men remained at the hut, ostensibly to guard the
prisoner, but in reality to blind the leader to the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the prisoner and firearms, while some of them attempted
to recover the rifles and revolvers.</p>

<p>Price had immediately set about carrying out his plan
to stock the abandoned mine with provision for a long
siege. He was shrewd enough to see he was between
two fires, and that when the pinch came he would receive
no assistance from the Washington side of the
ring. Neither could he take refuge among the Indians,
for several of the tribes had learned to hate him, and he
was safe only with some bands of renegades whom he
had employed. A few tough characters, white and red,
were still loyal to him, and with these well armed and
gathered about him in the mountain stronghold he could
defy the government and its officers.</p>

<p>The second night following the carousal at the hut
Price had sent a dozen pack mules to the hills laden
with supplies of various kinds. Six mounted men went
with them, and were to return the following night for
another load.</p>

<p>Price was carrying on his preparations with secrecy,
in spite of the fact that he believed he had downed Buffalo
Bill and his band. He wished to keep the fact that
he was furnishing a rendezvous from as many of the
people of the town as possible and its location from all
except his own men.</p>

<p>But it so happened that Red Dick and half a dozen
cowpunchers were coming to town that night for a
round of sport. They met the small caravan and wondered
what it could mean. They asked the men who
were with the pack mules, but received such evasive replies
that they determined to learn for themselves where
this consignment was going.</p>

<p>Quietly following the trail by the occasional wheezy
call of one of the mules, Red Dick and his men were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
far behind when the caravan entered the trail that led to
the old mine. There they dismounted, and tethered their
horses, and followed on foot to the end of the trail.</p>

<p>Red Dick and his men were near enough to hear the
challenge of the guard at the lower entrance to the mine,
and watched the lanterns disappear down the incline.</p>

<p>Dick had recognized some of the men with the mules,
and knew that they were in some way mixed up with
Price, and it had been currently reported for a long
time that Price was stealing the best of the Indian supplies.
Red Dick figured it out that here was another
batch of goods that belonged to the government. His
narrow but active mind was in a whirl over the discovery.
Here were goods that belonged to him as much as
to Price. Price was stealing from both government and
the Indians. He was hiding his plunder here, and &#8220;finding
is keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick laid the case before his followers. They
agreed with him in every particular, and would stand by
him to a man.</p>

<p>Then Dick built a plot of his own to obtain possession
of the loot. With his men he would hide in the hills and
watch, and if all six of Price&#8217;s men came out again, after
they had gone he would enter and take possession, without
any difficulty, and what he and his men could carry
away in one day would be worth many hundred dollars.
If they did not all come out&mdash;well, he would go in, anyway,
and once inside, if he had to fight to hold it, he
would, for Price wouldn&#8217;t dare call on State or Federal
officials for aid.</p>

<p>Red Dick and his men decided to remain very near the
trail and mount guard all night. They were quite carried
away with the prospect.</p>

<p>Very early the following morning Fighting Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Grey and several gamblers and sporting men, led by an
old plainsman, were coming to town. They had heard
rumors of an impending Indian uprising, and had seen
several bands crossing to the Yellowstone from Flathead
Pass. They wanted to know what Bozeman folk
had heard.</p>

<p>A short distance outside the town the plainsman noted
that a trail of horsemen which he had been following
ran into one coming out of Bozeman, and both turned
south. He called Fighting Dan&#8217;s attention to it, and the
latter jumped to the conclusion that one party was made
up of Indians, and they were on the trail of some mining
party for purposes of robbery.</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose we saunter down thet way an&#8217; see &#8217;f we can&#8217;t
surprise Mr. Redskin in his funny bus&#8217;ness,&#8221; suggested
Dan.</p>

<p>The entire party veered sharply and cantered toward
the hills. As they neared the first ravine where the trail
became faint they were surprised to see six men on
horseback, leading twice as many mules, coming out.
Fighting Dan halted and awaited the approach of Price&#8217;s
party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen any Injuns?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>

<p>The spokesman of Price&#8217;s men feared the presence of
this party so near the storehouse, and he hit upon a plan
to get rid of them. He answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we hain&#8217;t seen any sence yistidy. The pesky
hoss thieves run off with our mules, an&#8217; we chased &#8217;em
so hard they skedaddled into the hills an&#8217; left the mules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way&#8217;d they go?&#8221; asked Dan, feeling this excuse
to punish a band of red men was too good to be
lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;They kep&#8217; south, round the mounting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we better skate down that way a bit; eh, boys?&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;re yer highbucks,&#8221; came the answer, and away
Fighting Dan&#8217;s party dashed.</p>

<p>When well beyond the view of the mule men, Fighting
Dan pulled up and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest yer plugs while Lex and me scouts er bit. Them
fellers hain&#8217;t seen any Injuns, and their mules hadn&#8217;t
been stampeded. Some o&#8217; them chaps belong to Price&#8217;s
gang, and I&#8217;ll bet my hoss they had been down here ter
hide some guv&#8217;ment supplies till they get a chance to ship
&#8217;em. Ye see the officers are gittin&#8217; pretty clost hauls on
Price, and he&#8217;s takin&#8217; care of his stuff. What d&#8217; ye say,
boys? Haven&#8217;t we a right to a share in ther loot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a safe bet we have, and we are the boys that can
take the goods if your human bloodhound can lead us to
&#8217;em,&#8221; came the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ther talk! Now, Lex an&#8217; me&#8217;ll go on a still
hunt fer ther trail, an&#8217; you fellers stay here ready for a
charge to the rescue if you hear fireworks. If Price has
got any valerbles here he ain&#8217;t ther fool ter leave &#8217;em
uncovered, an&#8217; it may mean er scrap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fighting Dan and his plainsman set out on foot, and
first climbed well into the mountains, where they could
command a view of the plain to the northward, to see if
the men with the mules kept on. They had held straight
toward town, so Dan and his trailer chose the best footing
possible back around the mountain to the trail they
had left.</p>

<p>At last they saw where the mules had just passed out,
and took the back trail into the mountains. A little
farther on they discovered that another party on horseback
had struck the trail ahead of them and were following
in the way the mules had come out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be riddled with forty-fours!&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Dan. &#8220;This gets me all right. Who be these other chaps
thet hev jumped ther claim ahead of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are white men,&#8221; answered Lex, &#8220;for their
horses are shod.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Now, let&#8217;s go cautious, an&#8217; not run inter
any shootin&#8217; bees &#8217;thout havin&#8217; our own powder dry.
This is gittin&#8217; as interestin&#8217; as er game o&#8217; odd an&#8217; even,
with beans for stake money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later Fighting Dan and Lex passed
around a jutting ledge and beheld six horsemen pulled
up in front of the black mouth of the old mine. They
seemed to be holding parley with invisible parties in the
darkness beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Red Dick, or I&#8217;m ther living image of a liar!&#8221;
gasped Dan.</p>

<p>He watched for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Lex; you let me hev yore guns ter go with
mine, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll keep &#8217;em in there if they try to get out,
while you go back arter ther boys. If there&#8217;s any honey
to be passed round, Red Dick ain&#8217;t goin &#8217;ter sweeten
his lips. What!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lex stole away, and Fighting Dan looked to his guns,
while from an angle in the rocks above and behind the
gambler two more heads appeared.</p>

<p>They belonged to old Nomad and Skibo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>CAYUSE TURNS A TRICK.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Little Cayuse crept down to the mouth of the
mine, in the inky blackness of the very early morning,
after the moon had gone down, it was the native instinct
that led him in the narrow trail along the brink of the
abyss. His tread was noiseless, in spite of the uneven
footing and unseen obstacles. Looking up toward the
sky, he could follow the dim outline of the mountaintop
and knew he was near the entrance to the mine. Then
the strong odor of tobacco smoke came to his nostrils.
For an instant the Indian youth felt that the smoker must
be within reach of his arm. In breathless silence he
listened:</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;ff, p&#8217;ff, p&#8217;ff,&#8221; came the soft forcing of the smoke
through enjoying lips. Then a moist piece of tobacco
in the pipe sizzled spitefully, and minute sparks shot up
from the bowl for an instant, disclosing the half-closed
eyes of the guard.</p>

<p>Cayuse crouched low and awaited some movement of
the man that would drown the slight rustle of his own
advance.</p>

<p>Deliberately and comfortably the guard puffed away
until his pipe had gone out. Then he yawned and
dropped his pipe, during which performance Cayuse had
passed him and felt the more even footing of the interior
under his moccasins.</p>

<p>But he had barely passed into the mouth of the mine,
and while not ten feet from the guard, when the latter
suddenly became stiff and silent, as if listening intently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Then Cayuse heard the faint swish of clothing for a
moment, and then the sudden scrape of a match along a
trouser leg, followed by the splutter and bright glare of
a match.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s hand was on his revolver, and his muscles
were tense as whipcords, as the guard held the match
aloft and peered out into the night, trying to pierce the
darkness beyond the narrow circle of light.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment for the Piute. If the guard
turned his head ever so slightly before the match went
out, he could catch a glimpse of the intruder, and neither
would know what action the other might take.</p>

<p>Cayuse&#8217;s black eyes watched the man&#8217;s head as the
match flickered and went out. He was not discovered.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, and then Cayuse
heard the guard fumbling on the floor for his pipe, swearing
softly the while.</p>

<p>Once more Cayuse advanced, while the other was occupied.</p>

<p>The guard was filling his smoker again, and Cayuse
gained many feet.</p>

<p>Now another match flared up, and in the intermittent
flashes, as the guard sucked the blaze into his bowl,
Cayuse plainly saw the features of the man.</p>

<p>It was Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>With catlike movements the Indian boy felt his way
down the slope. Here and there the rotting brattice
crumbled at his touch, and pieces fell with a soft thud,
but he was now far from the guard at the mouth.</p>

<p>He was tempted to strike a match, but denied himself
the comfort of a glance at his surroundings, fearing another
guard might be posted where there was a divergence
of slopes or at the spot where Pa-e-has-ka and
Hickok were held.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>After a time a faint light glimmered ahead, and loomed
larger as he advanced. It was a lantern hung overhead,
which shed feeble rays on its surroundings.</p>

<p>Along the walls were tiered many bales in various
forms and sizes. It was the storehouse of the gang.
Leaning against the bales in the full glare of the lantern
sat a man on a box. His cooling pipe had fallen on
his breast, the under jaw had dropped, and the inner
guard of the mine stronghold was breathing stertorously.</p>

<p>Cayuse looked for other men of Price&#8217;s gang, but none
were within reach of the lantern&#8217;s rays.</p>

<p>But the keen eyes of the Piute fell on something that
interested him far more. His heart jumped with joy,
for there, only a few feet from the sleeping guard, lay
two men, both seemingly asleep.</p>

<p>They were Pa-e-has-ka and the Laramie man.</p>

<p>Both were bound, hand and foot, and were lying on a
little pile of hay, over which a blanket had been thrown.</p>

<p>To advance boldly into the light might precipitate a
shot from some unseen guard. But every moment was
precious. What should he do first? The sleeping sentry,
heavily armed, was a dark-visaged, vicious-looking fellow.
If Cayuse first attempted to release Pa-e-has-ka
and Hickok and he was fired upon, he would be imperiling
lives more valuable than his own.</p>

<p>But Little Cayuse&#8217;s head was clear, his determination
strong, and his heart brave.</p>

<p>Advancing softly, Cayuse, expecting every instant to
hear the crack of a revolver and feel the lead burning
through his vitals, reached the lantern, and turned the
blaze low.</p>

<p>The heavy breathing of the guard and the prisoners
continued.</p>

<p>Very gently the keen knife of the Indian boy slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
through the bonds of Pa-e-has-ka. Then the ropes fell
from the wrists and ankles of Wild Bill.</p>

<p>The three men slept on.</p>

<p>Cayuse hesitated for a moment, then slightly shook
Pa-e-has-ka. The scout awoke to find Cayuse&#8217;s finger
pressed to his lips.</p>

<p>Cayuse shook Hickok, and the latter would have
started up and spoken but for the restraining hand of the
Piute.</p>

<p>Into the hand of each Little Cayuse pushed a revolver,
and then they understood. Pressing his mouth to the
scout&#8217;s ear, Cayuse whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guard asleep; Pa-e-has-ka shut off wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout arose noiselessly. Cayuse turned on the
light a little. Buffalo Bill crept up to the sleeping man,
Cayuse slipping close to one side. Then, as the scout
suddenly seized the man&#8217;s wrists in a grip of iron, Cayuse
clapped both hands over his mouth.</p>

<p>The struggle was short and almost noiseless. Hickok
brought a rope and prepared a gag. Then the lantern
was turned low, and behind an angle in the wall the
three men whispered council. Two more men were to
be disposed of&mdash;Ike and another, one at each opening
into the mine.</p>

<p>The scout had heard the guards say they would await
relief from town till two hours after sunup; then they
would come in for breakfast. But they expected two
more of Price&#8217;s gang before that time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Price&#8217;s men reached town and told him of
meeting Fighting Dan in the foothills, the agent became
alarmed. He feared the proximity of such men who
might take a notion to investigate the trail that led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the mine. If they should discover that the place was
guarded their curiosity would be correspondingly heightened,
and who could tell what they might do?</p>

<p>Price hurriedly called the sheriff and all the men he
could muster on whom he could depend, and had them
sworn as deputies. He would go prepared to have his
own way. If Fighting Dan had captured his plunder he
would have Dan and his men arrested, charged with
robbing a mine in operation.</p>

<p>Price would swear that he and his men were getting
ready to work the old claim. The sheriff and his deputies
would take oath to the same. The municipal judge
would know what to do. He had fixed many cases for
Price and the cattlemen, who were his friends.</p>

<p>With the sheriff and posse of twenty men the Indian
agent hurried away.</p>

<p>The townspeople were full of wonder, and not a few
rode out toward the foothills, hoping to have their curiosity
relieved. Many rumors were started, among them
that a pocket had been opened in the mountains, and insiders
were staking claims.</p>

<p>Finally so much excitement had been aroused that
later in the day fully one hundred men were hastening
toward the hills, a few with picks and spades, some with
rifles and guns, some mounted, and others on foot.</p>

<p>The trail was plain and easily followed, and as those
in the lead entered the mountains they heard the sound
of battle. There was a rattle of shots, followed by silence
for a moment, and another volley; then a continuous
popping of revolvers and rifles.</p>

<p>The cavalcade paused and sent on scouts to investigate.
It was evident that the sheriff and his posse had found
plenty of business.</p>

<p>After a time the scouts reported that a general engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was going on, in which it seemed that several
small parties were taking part, each for itself. From
the top of a bluff just beyond the battlefield could be
safely viewed. Hither the crowd rushed, those with
mounts going as far as possible on horseback, and then,
hitching their animals, clambering up the rocks on foot.</p>

<p>A strange picture was presented. At the furthermost
point of the engagement, several men were huddled in
the mouth of the lower entrance to the mine slopes. They
were shooting from behind rocks and timbers outward
at another party among the bowlders, ten rods away.</p>

<p>A third party, which could now be made out as the
sheriff and his posse, had taken a hand from a position
higher up and commanding an equal rake of both the
others.</p>

<p>All were well among the broken granite and in little
danger except of getting pinked when poking out a
head or hand to get a shot at the other fellows. If any
damage had been done the victims had been concealed
in the rocks by their friends.</p>

<p>The country was too rough to attempt a charge, and
the sheriff&#8217;s party, which numbered as many men as the
others combined, could not dislodge either of them.</p>

<p>Suddenly the men at the mouth of the slope arose and
darted back into the murky interior out of view. The
second party seemed to be greatly surprised and disconcerted
for a moment, and then turned their whole attention
to the sheriff&#8217;s posse, popping away as often as a
bit of flesh or apparel appeared.</p>

<p>It was amusing to the onlookers to see a man bob up
like a Jack-in-a-box in one place and then another, to
bang away at the enemy, and then drop out of sight.</p>

<p>Presently the second party made a sudden dash for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the cover of the mine, where their erstwhile enemies had
disappeared.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the sheriff and his men arose,
one after another, and stared helplessly at the place
where the enemy had disappeared. They could not understand
this man&oelig;uvre. They had come upon two
bands of fighting men, and had taken a hand at settling
the dispute by attempting to wipe out both parties. Now
the former enemies had nested together&mdash;either had come
to an understanding or had gone beyond reach of the
third party to fight it out alone.</p>

<p>Agent Price rubbed his eyes and stared at the hole in
the mountain, then held conversation with the sheriff. It
seemed to the onlookers that they must have agreed upon
some plan, for they at once began a movement which
eventually placed them in the position just vacated by
the last party to take refuge in the mine.</p>

<p>Here the sheriff halted, not daring to enter the frowning
interior, where a dozen or so well-armed men might
pour a disastrous volley into them from the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>The sheriff and Price held council behind the shelter
of the bowlders.</p>

<p>Then the watchers saw another sight that puzzled
them still further. Out from the upper entrance to the
mine filed a column of men. They ranged themselves
along the upper shelf without a sound, each man with
ready rifle or revolver, and then crept slowly up to the
brink, where they could look down upon the unprotected
sheriff and his men. They had nearly reached
the objective point when in the lower entrance appeared
a figure with wildly waving arms, who shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;In here, quick! It&#8217;s a trap! They&#8217;re over your
heads!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Before Price and the sheriff could understand, the
men above had risen with leveled guns, and a big voice
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands up, or we&#8217;ll blow you into the rocks!&#8221;</p>

<p>And their hands went up as their weapons dropped,
for resistance was useless. The rocks which sheltered
them from an enemy on a level with their footing protected
them no longer.</p>

<p>While all but two of the men above kept them covered
those two descended and disarmed the entire party. The
sheriff protested, and threatened, and proclaimed his authority,
but he was made a prisoner, together with the
man who represented the United States Government in
its Indian service.</p>

<p>The surrender had barely been affected when the entire
mountaintop seemed to shiver for a moment and then
settle, together with terrific rumble and roar that threw
men to the ground.</p>

<p>From the mouths of the mine blew volumes of rock,
timbers, and d√©bris. Then columns of black smoke and
gaseous vapors poured out until the sky overhead was
darkened.</p>

<p>The mine had been wrecked and rendered impenetrable
by some gigantic upheaval.</p>

<p>For a few minutes all were overwhelmed with surprise
and awe, then Price, who was the first to recover,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the work of Bloody Ike, and he&#8217;s in there, buried
under a million tons of rock!&#8221;</p>

<small>BUFFALO BILL&#8217;S TRUMP CARD.</small></h2></div>


<p>After the scout and Hickok had been released by Little
Cayuse and had bound the interior guard, they had set
about the capture of the men posted at the entrances to
the slope. They first crept out to the upper level, and
surprised Bloody Ike. He was treated as the first had
been, and carried back into the mine to rest on the hay
where the scout and Hickok had lain.</p>

<p>The next work was to go down to the lower entrance
to take in the other guard. As they approached the
light they heard the voice of the guard in conversation
with some one on the outside.</p>

<p>Creeping nearer until they could command a view of
the rocks beyond, the scout was surprised to see Red
Dick and his men lined up and held at bay by the sentry,
who was warning them not to come any nearer. He
told them that he had ten well-armed men behind him,
and if they attempted to enter he would blow them into
mince meat.</p>

<p>After long parley Red Dick attempted to retreat, but
found himself confronted by Fighting Dan and his crowd.</p>

<p>Red Dick was between two fires, but preferred to take
the chances that the guard had lied about having men
behind him. Dick in an undertone directed his men, and
all suddenly dashed into the slope. There they were
met by the leveled rifles, not only of Buffalo Bill, the
Laramie man, and Little Cayuse, but of the surprised
guard himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;Fight it out where you are,&#8221; commanded the scout,
&#8220;or we&#8217;ll take a hand from this side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Dick and his men made the best of a bad situation,
and dropped among the rocks to send a volley at
Fighting Dan&#8217;s crowd, now beginning to advance.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the sheriff and his posse appeared.
Then the battle had become triangular.</p>

<p>The scout first relieved the mine guard of his weapons,
and secured his hands and feet to guard against
treachery, and then hit upon a scheme to catch a thief
with a thief.</p>

<p>Most of all, Buffalo Bill wanted Price, and the sheriff,
and Dave Green. He had Bloody Ike and two minor
villains, but the ringleaders still stood a good chance of
escape if they once understood that the round-up had
begun.</p>

<p>The scout called to Red Dick:</p>

<p>&#8220;Davids, I&#8217;ve a proposition to make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no particular friend of Price and the sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see &#8217;em hung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I want to catch them both, and if you and Dan
Grey will join me we can do it without bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am William F. Cody, sent here by the government
to put the kibosh on some of your rascals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boiling rattlesnakes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you, head and heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; make a rush in here, and then I&#8217;ll talk
to Grey.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we have seen, Red Dick and his men disappeared,
much to the surprise of the others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Then Buffalo Bill opened negotiations with Fighting
Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan Grey!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it,&#8221; came the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;n&#8217; I dunno&#8217;s I want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m Cody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Buffalo Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ye want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you and your men to come in here out of the
sun; you might tan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s ther game?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout briefly outlined the situation as he had to
Red Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out fur &#8217;nough so&#8217;s I can see ye, an&#8217; if it&#8217;s you
I&#8217;ll jine in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill advanced until he was in full view of
Fighting Dan and his men, yet beyond sight of the sheriff&#8217;s
party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s Buffler all right,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;Waal, clear
ther track, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll come in under full steam.&#8221;</p>

<p>They came and the rest we know&mdash;how the entire
party, under Buffalo Bill&#8217;s direction, went around to the
upper entrance and sprung the trap that nabbed the
sheriff, Price, and their band.</p>

<p>But how Bloody Ike attempted to defeat the plans has
not been explained.</p>

<p>Back in the mine the scout had offered those who had
guarded the place the choice of joining his party in the
capture of Price. Two had accepted, but Bloody Ike refused,
so he was left securely bound, it was supposed.
But in some manner he had escaped and tried to warn
Price of the trap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Failing in that and apparently thinking that the game
was played out, it was believed that he had set off a
storehouse of explosives and had died where his bones
would never be disturbed.</p>

<p>The procession back to town was quite a remarkable
one. Buffalo Bill had made sure that the principal prisoners
were safely guarded, and among his most zealous
supporters were Dan, the fighting man, and Red Dick,
the wild and woolly knight of the bad men&#8217;s resorts.</p>

<p>Skibo was given charge of the sheriff, and Wild Bill
had Price under his watchful eye. Old Nomad, the
scout, and Cayuse herded the rest of the prisoners, while
the former enemies, Dick, and Dan, and their followers,
acted as outriders.</p>

<p>The crowd of curious trooped along in the rear.</p>

<p>But the incident was not to close without one more
adventure for the scout and his pards.</p>

<p>The day had passed rapidly with the exciting incidents,
and darkness overtook the small army before it
had covered half the distance to town.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had foreseen this and also the possibilities
of escape that might come to some of his prisoners. He
had instructed Skibo and Hickok, whatever happened, to
give their whole attention to the sheriff and Price. Those
two must be safely landed to answer for their betrayal
of public trust.</p>

<p>Suddenly from all quarters at once&mdash;in front, rear,
and along both sides of them, came wild yells and a rain
of bullets.</p>

<p>Instantly there was panic, and had the Indians followed
up the first volley with a charge a slaughter must
have followed.</p>

<p>But like a whirlwind Buffalo Bill dashed along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
outside, giving orders in a stern, business-like way, until
he had completely encircled his party.</p>

<p>A circle was formed with the horses on the outside,
and then wherever the flash of a gun was seen a bullet
was immediately sent.</p>

<p>Several men had been wounded at the first onset, and
one horse was killed. Other horses were suffering from
wounds.</p>

<p>It looked as if the entire party would have to remain
as they were until morning unless some one could pass
the Indian line and bring aid from the town.</p>

<p>The scout felt sure it was some war party bound
south who had discovered this strange caravan of palefaces,
and hoped to reap a fine collection of scalps, and
then go on before the soldiers could strike back.</p>

<p>The Indians had completely surrounded their intended
victims before their presence was known.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse volunteered to attempt to crawl through
the Indian lines. If any living being could do it Cayuse
was the one, but Buffalo Bill consented reluctantly.
There might be a chance, but a hundred to one it meant
sure death for him who attempted it.</p>

<p>The war party was evidently a strong one, as the long
line indicated. That they were Sioux and thirsting for
blood there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse shook hands with the scout and all his
pards, then threw his arms for a moment around Navi&#8217;s
neck, and slipped away under the bellies of the horses
and out into the grass toward the zone of spitting fire
and lead.</p>

<p>The scout had almost decided to call to Cayuse to
come back when another surprising thing distracted the
attention of all for the moment.</p>

<p>To the northward was heard the well-known yell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Crow warriors and the roar of many fiercely galloping
hoofs.</p>

<p>The moon just appearing over distant hills sent its rays
over a wildly troubled half mile square.</p>

<p>The second band of Indians came sweeping down
upon the Sioux, who swung to their saddles to meet the
foe. But when they did so they became the targets of
Buffalo Bill&#8217;s party, who did not hesitate to turn in a
withering fire.</p>

<p>Attacked from two sides at once and scattered as they
were, the Sioux wheeled their ponies and dashed away
to the southward.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill&#8217;s party made all possible speed toward
town with their injured, but before a half hour had
passed the Crow warriors rode up and one chief came
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ai,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;White-man-runs-him remember the knife. It is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Crows rode away, and the party of whites entered
the town.</p>

<p>The people of Bozeman gave a banquet in honor of
Buffalo Bill and his pards, and rejoiced that the influence
of Price and those who followed his lead would be no
longer felt.</p>

<small>BUFFALO BILL&#8217;S DIFFICULT MISSION.</small></h2></div>


<p>In answer to Buffalo Bill&#8217;s report of the iniquity
he had unearthed in the Gallatin Valley, and the discovery
that various tribes of Sioux were massing in the Bad
Lands and raiding ranches and herders far and near,
came an order to him from the authorities in Washington
to get in touch with Sitting Bull himself, if possible.
To the scout&#8217;s knowledge of Indian characteristics and
customs and his well-known sympathies for the red man
were intrusted a difficult mission of peace. He was to
undertake to persuade the tribes to voluntarily abandon
the Black Hills, and take up their abode on lands selected
for them by the government in Indian Territory.
It was the plan of the government to gather the various
tribes in peaceful community there and provide for their
sustenance by annual appropriation.</p>

<p>The powerful Sioux chief had refused to comply, and
every resource of the government was being exhausted
to bring about the desired end without resorting to arms.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill went to what is now the respectable city
of Livingston, on the Yellowstone River, and there
awaited orders. Skibo, however, went south to the valley
of the Little Popo-agie to take part in the house
warming of his friends, the Staffords, and Nick Nomad
had returned to Virginia City on business of his own.</p>

<p>On receiving his orders, Buffalo Bill at once sent
word to Bozeman, where Nomad and Skibo would next
report, for them to follow the Yellowstone, stopping at
the military posts for instructions. Then, with Wild Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and Little Cayuse, he himself began the journey down
the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>At that critical period of the country&#8217;s Indian history
it was destined to be one of the most dangerous and
thrilling of the scout&#8217;s career. Everywhere the Sioux
were retaliating for their wrongs, fancied or real, upon
the white settlers. The young warriors, aroused by the
call of the great chief, had accepted it as a general license
for plunder. They had spread over a territory with a
radius of hundreds of miles, and struck swiftly and relentlessly,
ever replenishing their mounts from the best
of the herds they raided.</p>

<p>To Buffalo Bill had been awarded a herculean task.
With the daring Wild Bill Hickok and the faithful Cayuse,
he set forth to meet a foe which one thousand
mounted soldiers could not have hoped to subdue. But
with peace in his mission, the brave plainsman hoped to
accomplish that which rifle ball and sword could not do&mdash;the
pacification of the tribes without bloodshed.</p>

<p>Scarce a day&#8217;s ride to the east the scout came upon the
smouldering dugout of a settler and the mutilated bodies
of the settler, his wife, and children, and on the grazing
lands near by the carcasses of the slaughtered stock.</p>

<p>The bodies of the human victims of the red man&#8217;s fury
were buried by the scout and his pards, who went on into
a little ravine, where they camped for the night. They
did not build a fire because of the evident proximity of
blood-mad foes and the danger of a surprise.</p>

<p>The scout himself took the first watch, while his companions
rolled in their blankets for a snatch of rest after
a long day in the saddle.</p>

<p>It was a moonless, starless night, and the light wind
seethed through the dead grass drearily, portending a
storm, before which the night prowlers were silenced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
On a little hillock near where the horses were picking
out the green things from the sear, the scout stood
silently, smoking his pipe and studying his surroundings.
He fully realized the difficulties of his undertaking, and
was at the same time aware that none of his superiors
at Washington could in any measure grasp its possibilities.
It was easy enough to tick off a message to a man
two thousand miles away to hunt out the reputed head of
a hostile people scattered over a territory as large as
France and Germany combined, and convince this leader
of the error of his ways, but its accomplishment was a
far different matter.</p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill never offered excuses or demurred.
Knowledge that his superiors were ignorant of the magnitude
of their demands did not deter him from an attempt
to obey. What he had accomplished only went
to headquarters.</p>

<p>The scout suddenly jerked the pipe from his teeth, and
bent forward, fixing his gaze on a point to northward,
where the sky line was lighting up with lurid flashes.</p>

<p>For a moment the scout stood thus, and then bounded
back to his companions, and shook them roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of it, pards!&#8221; he said; &#8220;there&#8217;s work for us to
the northward.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was away again, jerking the lariat pins from the
ground and cinching the saddles upon the horses.</p>

<p>Tn two minutes the three had gathered their possessions
and were galloping toward the red glare which seemed
several miles across the uneven country.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes&#8217; sharp riding showed the scout that
they were much nearer the fire than they had supposed.
As they rode out on the rim of a basin they saw below
them the full tragedy they had feared. Pulling in their
horses, they could now hear the yells of red murderers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at their work and see them darting about in the light of
burning buildings, haystacks, and farming implements.</p>

<p>From a little hillside beyond now came a spit of flame,
followed by the report of a gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the ranch folk are still alive and making a
stand-off from a dugout, I should say,&#8221; observed the
Laramie man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so I see, but the Indians are going to drive them
out&mdash;see those fellows coming over the hill. They will
scrape the gravel off the top of the dugout and set fire
to it,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are only about twenty of the reds,&#8221; observed
Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are only about three of us,&#8221; answered Buffalo
Bill. &#8220;But something must be done or the settler
and his family will be murdered,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Let us
drop back behind this swell and ride farther north, then
swing in behind those fellows who are preparing to fire
the dugout, and charge. If we can&#8217;t stampede them we
can at least give them a touch of heart failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My fingers are itching on the trigger, pard,&#8221; said
Hickok.</p>

<p>In the rear of the little hill on which three Indians
could be seen digging away the gravel and thatch, while
other warriors were yelling, shooting, and dancing about
the burning buildings to distract the attention of those
imprisoned in the dugout, the scout and his pards approached
more cautiously. They climbed to within a
few rods of the three reds before the scout, drawing
two revolvers, drove the spurs to Bear Paw&#8217;s flanks, and
dashed forward.</p>

<p>The red men, taken wholly by surprise, were run down
by the flying horses without a shot, and the animals, leaping
the sharp embankment, like a cyclone swept across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the intervening space, and, before the red warriors in the
firelight could see what was approaching from the darkness
beyond, they were greeted by a deadly volley as
the three daring horsemen swept through and over them
and disappeared in the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>The scout had so planned the charge as to strike the
group of Indian ponies, and among them the pards madly
galloped, yelling like demons and shooting right and left.</p>

<p>In a moment the little animals were scurrying away
across the prairie, and the scout and his pards saw to it
that they were hustled far, and widely scattered, before
they began a wide detour that took them back toward
the scene.</p>

<p>The Indians had been so completely demoralized by the
sudden onslaught that they did not recover from their
surprise until the ponies were far away in the darkness
and the sound of their hoofbeats was rapidly lessening
in the distance. Then the warriors scarcely knew which
way to turn. Their first move was flight beyond the firelight,
where they momentarily expected another mysterious
and avenging force to spring.</p>

<p>The sounds of yelling and shooting had ceased; the
fire had burned itself down to glowing brands, and the
lowing of frightened cattle echoed here and there when
Buffalo Bill, Hickok, and Cayuse for the second time
approached the back side of the mound in which the
dugout had been made.</p>

<p>Leaving Hickok and the Piute with the horses in a dip
of the hill where they were safe from surprise, the scout
made his way noiselessly over the hilltop, approached
the door of the dugout, and spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there, within!&#8221;</p>

<p>A boy&#8217;s voice answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;A white friend; the Indians are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no Injun trick to git us out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the scout in his kindliest voice; &#8220;a
party of us have come to save you from the Indians, but
if you are all right and comfortable perhaps you had
better stay there till morning. Was anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that we knows of&mdash;ye see, there&#8217;s only Nellie,
an&#8217; Kittie, an&#8217; me; dad an&#8217; mom has gone to a weddin&#8217;
up to Jenkinses&#8217; ranch, an&#8217; we&#8217;s afeared that mebbe the
Injuns got &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to be in the dugout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I seen the Injuns comin&#8217; jes&#8217; before dark, an&#8217; I
rushed the girls in here, an&#8217; got all the guns an&#8217; things I
could before the reds got near enough to shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that a boy and two girls are all there
are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all&mdash;me an&#8217; Nellie an&#8217; Kittie&mdash;I&#8217;m fourteen,
Nellie is twelve, an&#8217; Kittie is ten,&#8221; answered the boy
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a plucky lad, and you made a good
stand-off, but you needn&#8217;t worry any more to-night.
Which way did your parents go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor&#8217;east.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way did the Indians come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor&#8217;west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all right; I guess they didn&#8217;t get your father
and mother, my boy, and as soon as daylight we&#8217;ll see if
we can look them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout and his pards spent the rest of the night
near the dugout, determined, if need be, to defend the
three little children with their last drop of blood.</p>

<p>But their services were not needed, for the Indians
had slunk away to find their ponies, and if they succeeded
in securing their mounts before light they gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the place where they had met such mysterious disaster a
wide berth.</p>

<p>In the morning a bright, manly lad and his two handsome
but shy little sisters came forth from the dugout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad to bring up such children here!&#8221; exclaimed
Hickok to the scout, but the boy overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dad&#8217;s cough,&#8221; said he apologetically. &#8220;Uncle
John gave us the ranch, an&#8217; dad an&#8217; mom thought we
could live here a few years till he gets stronger, an&#8217; then
go East, where the girls an&#8217; me c&#8217;n go to school.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I guess dad an&#8217; mom&#8217;ll be &#8217;bout discouraged now,
with no house to live in an&#8217; some of our cows an&#8217; sheep
killed,&#8221; he went on chokingly.</p>

<p>The great-hearted Buffalo Bill cleared his throat before
he spoke, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, you must cheer up your dad and mom.
They have what is worth far more than home and live
stock&mdash;three noble children. If your father is ill you
must come to the front. You have shown that it is in
you&mdash;I mean pluck and resourcefulness. Don&#8217;t ever forget
to be honest and always guard your father and
mother and sisters&mdash;not only their lives, but their happiness.
Sometimes kind words are life savers. Don&#8217;t
forget to always have words and looks of cheer for your
father and mother, and to jealously watch over the purity
of the names of your sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes shone with the light of a new determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, mister,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I was such a sissy last night
that I cried when the girls did, because we thought how
bad dad an&#8217; mom&#8217;d feel &#8217;thout any home, but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to cry no more as long&#8217;s we&#8217;re all alive&mdash;an&#8217; if dad c&#8217;n
get better we&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout did not wish to dampen the lad&#8217;s courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but he determined to tell the father to take his family to
some of the larger settlements until the Sioux had been
quieted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were your father and mother to return this morning?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Say, mister, do you care if I ask what your
name is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my boy; my name is Cody; sometimes called
&#8216;Buffalo Bill.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad started back and gasped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re a scout! I&#8217;ve read lots about you in the
papers that Uncle John sends us. Mr. Cody, would you
shake hands with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout laughed heartily as he grasped the boy&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the right sort, Cody,&#8221; observed Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;William Fisher Corey.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout and Hickok laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;His initials are the same as yours, Cody,&#8221; the Laramie
man said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we&#8217;ll have to call him &#8216;Little Buffalo
Bill.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was delighted, and his sisters shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Little Buffalo Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy stood back, and admired the scout for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish my dad was as big an&#8217; strong an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; handsome
as you be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout blushed at the frank admiration of the boy,
but laughingly turned it off and suggested that they
round up the scattered cattle of the settler.</p>

<small>A TRAGEDY OF THE PLAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>A lonely shack left by Northern Pacific surveyors, on
the rolling prairie perhaps one hundred and fifty miles
east of Gallatin, showed evidence of habitation in the
early morning of a balmy summer day. Ten rods away,
in a sag almost hidden by sage brush, a pair of Indian
ponies grazed peacefully.</p>

<p>Two men came out of the hut, climbed the highest
ridge at hand, and scanned the horizon carefully, then
went back to start a little fire and prepare breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand how you got away from the fort,
Price,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough, Ike,&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;Remember
the crook-fingered &#8217;breed, Pete, who got nabbed for the
stage raid down toward Virginia City two years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may remember that I fixed it with the
judge, and he got off light?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-h&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pete was at the fort caring for the horses of
the officers. He knew me first glimpse, but he didn&#8217;t let
on, and when he got a chance he slipped me out with a
good mount, a sack of grub, and a belt full of guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete sort o&#8217; squared his bill, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did, and if you ever see a chance to slip Pete a
favor, Ike, on my account, I hope you&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet yer life, I will, Price, but I never did like that
Canadian polecat, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all in the same box, Ike&mdash;any of us would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
knife the guard for a run and take the chances of decorating
a rope. But most anything goes in this wild
country&mdash;it&#8217;s every man for himself and the devil take
the hindmost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the man that&#8217;s slow with his gun is the rear man
every time, I notice. Eh, Price?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hit the bull&#8217;s-eye, Ike, but you haven&#8217;t said it all.
I reckon I&#8217;ve got to keep my gun ready, and be quicker
than greased lightning till I get out of this territory.
Every man-jack, red and white, seems looking for my
scalp, except a few like you and Pete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a stiff upper lip, old man. I&#8217;m with you, and
the liveliest ghost Buffalo Bill and his pards ever run up
against. I want just one more whack at that crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you get it, Ike, and redeem your reputation.
Your giant powder seemed hoodooed over Bozeman
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a new lot in my bag, and it&#8217;s good for a free
ticket for the whole bunch of trail hunters, if I can get
a chance to put it under &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you get the chance, but I want first and most
to get as far from these Yankton Sioux and Crows as
possible. I want to hit south and make Laramie City
before I stop. Then I propose to prance in a different
harness for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know which way Buffalo Bill went after the
round-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was particular to keep my ears open till I was
sure of the course he was steering. He went to Helena
to rustle the boys up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do the soldiers think of Cody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they think he&#8217;s a wonder, and they swear by him
in seven languages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Between you and me, Price, he is the only man this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
side the hot place that could have done you and your
gang up in such short order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the only man who was too sharp to be caught by
your quick-trip tickets,&#8221; retorted Price.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him yet,&#8221; said Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will, as I said before, but when you do
will you please send me word, for I want a chance to
help pick up the pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If either of his ears is left whole I&#8217;ll send it to
you&mdash;&mdash; Roaring rattlesnakes! see there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cause of the exclamation of &#8220;Bloody Ike,&#8221; for it
was none other than the ex-miner, was the sight of two
red men leaned well forward on flying ponies. The Indians
were drumming incessantly the sides of the animals
in attempt to get more speed out of them, while
three hundred yards in the rear came a tall, gaunt horse,
with long, regular bounds that were gradually lessening
the distance between him and the ponies. On the back
of the horse sat a broad-shouldered, bewhiskered man
with eyes fixed on the red men and ready rifle across his
knees.</p>

<p>Now both Indians turned in the saddle and blazed
away at their pursuer, who neither hesitated, changed his
course, nor lifted his rifle.</p>

<p>The Indians began hurriedly to reload, working their
heels at the flanks of their ponies the while, with the
motions of a wooden monkey on a stick.</p>

<p>The trio were only half a mile away to the northward
and rapidly going east. The watchers at the shack
amused themselves by comments on the race, but admired
the cool determination of the white pursuer, who glanced
neither to right nor left, as the Indians again turned and
emptied their rifles at him.</p>

<p>Presently the red men tried different tactics&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
swerved, one to the right and the other to the left, and
each belabored his pony with renewed vigor, each possibly
hoping to gain fast enough so that the grim rider
behind would take up the pursuit of the other.</p>

<p>This was apparently what the pursuer had been looking
for, for his heels now went up, and the length and
rapidity of the stride of the powerful horse increased.</p>

<p>Rapidly now the distance was annihilated. But the Indians
were pulling apart, and he must soon select between
them.</p>

<p>Then the rifle which had laid idly across the white
man&#8217;s knees jumped to his shoulder. For an instant it
was held there, a part of the bobbing pantomime, and
then a yellow spurt left the muzzle, and instantly one of
the Indians threw up his arms, and with a wild yell
pitched from the back of his mustang.</p>

<p>The white man&#8217;s rifle dropped across his knees again,
and the great horse swept harder and closer on the trail
of the other red man.</p>

<p>Pursued and pursuer now tore away into the southeast,
the relentless white man sitting unmoved as the
Indian frantically loaded and fired at his pursuer.</p>

<p>And at last, with pursued and pursuer like ants on the
sky line, Price, the former Indian agent in the Gallatin
Valley, and his guilty companion, Bloody Ike, saw the
close of the tragedy.</p>

<p>There was a sudden halt of the pursuer, a rigid erectness
for an instant, a white puff, and the second Indian
plunged from the back of his staggering pony, but no
sound of shot or death yell came back over the intervening
distance.</p>

<p>They had witnessed one of the many tragedies of those
wild days in the great West&mdash;the days of an eye for an
eve and a tooth for a tooth; the days when revenge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
as sweet as ever and recognized in this ungoverned
region as the right of man.</p>

<p>Slowly the bewhiskered white rider came back over the
trail, and noting the presence of human beings at the old
shanty rode down to greet them with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what ye doin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Price&#8217;s first thought was of an insolent retort, but, remembering
the other&#8217;s decisive way of settling disputes,
softened his manner, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Resting after a hard day-and-night ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where be ye goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Working south, now, across the Yellowstone. Came
up to hunt down a horse thief Sioux, but lost him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many horses did he get?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two, but we want to settle with him more than to
get the ponies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thar&#8217;s a couple o&#8217; ponies I reckon you c&#8217;n have,
an&#8217; welcome; their owners won&#8217;t need &#8217;em any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the cause of the falling out you had with the
reds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Devils raided my corral last night and shot my father&mdash;they
won&#8217;t shoot any more fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You better take the ponies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything that ever belonged to one of
the red skunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stern ranchman rode away, and Price somehow
felt relief as those keen, dark eyes turned toward the
settler&#8217;s home and stopped boring under the skin of these
fugitives from the law.</p>

<p>Bloody Ike rode out and captured the ponies, and then
the two men set off southward, leading two animals not
their own. They hoped with these extra mounts to
make better time in their flight from the territory where
they were too well known for their own comfort. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Indians who were friendly with the whites had no
use for Price or his gang unless it were to provide amusement
at some torture party.</p>

<p>That was what Price feared, but he preferred to take
his chances of escape through a country swarming with
hostile red men to standing trial for his misdeeds with
the array of evidence against him provided by Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>Price was doubly glad that the grim ranchman was
a stranger to him. There were some of these plainsmen
who did not seem to understand a joke, and if they knew
the joke was on Uncle Sam they might insist on his&mdash;Price&#8217;s&mdash;company
back to the military camp.</p>

<p>But Price&#8217;s relief at getting off so easily was not long-lived,
as we soon shall see.</p>

<small>INTERESTING ACQUAINTANCES.</small></h2></div>


<p>Grizzled old Nick Nomad, solitary representative of
law and order on an expanse broader than the eye could
span, was making his lonely way eastward in what he understood
to be the wake of his pards. He was talking to
himself, possibly, but his conversation was directly addressed
to Hide-rack, the horse that the famous old trapper
and trailer loved better than any he ever bestrode.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look hyar, Hide-rack, yew cantankerous ole
heifercat, don&#8217;t ye reckon it&#8217;s &#8217;bout time ter pitch our
tent an&#8217; eat our doughnuts? We&#8217;ve plodded on middlin&#8217;
plenty sence sunup, an&#8217; sez I, Nick, ole boy, yer tummy
is makin&#8217; love ter yer backbone. What yer say, Hide-rack,
ye ole rye-an&#8217;-Injun mix-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad&#8217;s pet names might not have appealed to ears
more refined than Hide-rack&#8217;s, but the sound of his master&#8217;s
voice and the kindly pats on his neck that accompanied
them lifted the tired ears of the courageous animal,
and he briskly increased his pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Hide-rack, thet&#8217;s jest like ye&mdash;better arter a
sixty-mile run than ye wor at ther start-off. Yer ther
clear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By ther great horn spoon an&#8217; granny&#8217;s ole tin ladle!
Ef thar hain&#8217;t er c&#8217;ral-a-loomin&#8217; up ez big as life right off
here whar ther moon is goin&#8217; ter come up sometime,
mebbe. D&#8217;ye hyar thet, Hide-rack? The&#8217;s fodderin&#8217;s
an&#8217; comp&#8217;ny ahead. Boom &#8217;er up, ole hoss pard; we wants
ter make er showin&#8217; when we lite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably Hide-rack did not catch the full meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his man pard&#8217;s words, but at about that time his animal
instinct served notice that creatures of his kind were
nigh, and, raising his head, the horse, too, saw the human
habitation with all its suggestions of feed and rest.</p>

<p>The tired animal lifted head and tail, and, as Nomad
expressed it, &#8220;set sail fer ther c&#8217;ral lickerty split.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad dashed up to the ranch, or, rather, the
home of a stockman who had brought his family to the
plains, and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whooee! in thar&mdash;ye all dead, er on&#8217;y jes&#8217; nachally
givin&#8217; ther reds er chanst ter jump in an&#8217; gobble ther
hull kerboodle ov ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall, dark, broad-shouldered man with piercing eyes
and heavy beard stepped to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who ye be, but yer
welcome as long as ye behave yerself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Who ever hearn tell o&#8217; ole Nick Nomad
doin&#8217; anything else but behavin&#8217;? Stranger, yer better
look ergin. Mebbeso ye can see a ombray what is some
tired an&#8217; more er less hungry&mdash;mostly more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Climb down, old Nick Nomad, or the Old Nick hisself&mdash;neither
of ye&#8217;ll ever be turned away from Jasp
Avery&#8217;s door hungry. Git down, old man, an&#8217; come
right in; I&#8217;ll tend to yer hoss, same as if he be my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jasp Avery, I likes ther way ye holds yer mouth an&#8217;
swings yer under jaw. So off I comes, an&#8217; hyar&#8217;s my
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad went with the cowman, and saw that the
&#8220;faithful&#8221; Hide-rack didn&#8217;t accept an opportunity to
plant a pair of steel-shod heels in the anatomy of the
stranger who was offering hospitality.</p>

<p>Inside the home of the herdsman Nomad was introduced
to &#8220;Father Avery,&#8221; who was lying on a rudely
constructed lounge and emitting occasional groans.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>The story of an attack by Indians the previous night
soon came out, and Nomad heard of the climax with satisfaction.</p>

<p>The younger Avery explained that he had foreseen
trouble with the Indians and had sent his wife and children
to Fort Sarpy a month previous. His cowpunchers,
four of them, were all far back where they had gone
with the stock to find better grazing. He and his father
were alone, but they were well fortified and had plenty
of rifles and ammunition.</p>

<p>The house had been constructed with an eye to possible
hostilities, and resembled a miniature fort, out of
which led an underground passage to a dugout that
was concealed underground and ventilated by an opening
into an almost impenetrable thicket of willow and
sage brush.</p>

<p>The arrangement was well calculated to give a strong
band of attacking Indians a warm reception and a mystery
to wind it up, if they overpowered the settler and
set fire to the ranch house.</p>

<p>In his story of riding down and disposing of the Indians,
the younger Avery mentioned the two white men
he had passed on the plain. He said he didn&#8217;t like the
looks of them.</p>

<p>Old Nomad was instantly interested, and demanded a
description. Within five minutes he was convinced that
Avery had held conversation with the escaped Price and
the supposed-to-be-dead Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d bet Hide-rack ergin er grasshopper them&#8217;s ther
fellers!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;An&#8217; by ther harnsome whiskers
o&#8217; my Aunt Hannah&#8217;s billy goat I wish Buffler was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s &#8216;Buffler&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Avery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Buffler Bill, ther king o&#8217; ther plainsmen&#8217; an&#8217; ther
whitest man thet ever threw er leg over a saddle. He&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
my pard, Buffler is, an&#8217; he&#8217;s actin&#8217; fer ther gov&#8217;ment out
here ermong ther redskins. I&#8217;m on &#8217;is trail sence day
&#8217;fore yistidy f&#8217;m Bozeman. &#8217;Twas thar they tol&#8217; me Price
hed &#8217;scaped. I c&#8217;n see er hole in er ladder, an&#8217; thet
same is as how Bloody Ike warn&#8217;t blowed up, nohow,
an&#8217; he worked some scheme ter git Price out o&#8217; ther
hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is &#8216;Bloody Ike&#8217;?&#8221; asked Avery.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s ther onerariest polecat south o&#8217; Canady, an&#8217; he
travels with er bag o&#8217; blarstin&#8217; powder, an&#8217; is allers ready
ter touch et off when ennybuddy runs up ergin &#8217;im permiscous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s his last name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t never hearn tell&mdash;et&#8217;s jes&#8217; &#8216;Bloody Ike&#8217; over
in ther Gallatin country, an&#8217; et fits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know if it&#8217;s Ike Peltier, who used to do
ther blastin&#8217; in the Ten-nugget Mine. If &#8217;tis I&#8217;d give
ten o&#8217; my best hosses to be alone with &#8217;im about a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! I&#8217;d like jes&#8217; erbout ther same time with
thet pardner o&#8217; his. But, say, Neighbor Avery, yore eyes
aire some better&#8217;n gimlet holes, I take et&mdash;what du ye
call thet thar percession &#8217;bout five p&#8217;ints ter ther north o&#8217;
yer upper haystack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a party on hossback&mdash;one, two&mdash;eight, little an&#8217;
big, makin&#8217; this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye reckon, neighbor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t no guesser huntin&#8217; for a record, but I&#8217;m
willin&#8217; to predict it&#8217;s some rancher over east that&#8217;s been
raided by Injuns an&#8217; makin&#8217; for some other ranch or the
nearest settlement with what&#8217;s left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later old Nomad was dancing merrily
and waving his old slouch hat as Buffalo Bill, Hickok,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Little Cayuse, a sickly-looking man, a woman, a boy,
and two girls rode up.</p>

<p>It was the Corey family, whom Buffalo Bill had offered
to accompany to some spot more secure against the attacks
of roving bands of Indians, or, rather, bands making
for the Bad Lands to join Sitting Bull&#8217;s war party.
They were warmly greeted by young Avery and his
father, and invited to take up their home there for the
present.</p>

<p>Avery assured his visitors that two or three men could
defend the place against ten times their number of hostile
red men, and that he would call in his cowboys and
herds to closer quarters.</p>

<p>Corey&#8217;s herd with two cowboys were working that
way and would reach the section sometime the next day.
Avery promptly suggested that the herds be consolidated
and at least one of the cowboys left always at the
ranch for the protection of the non-combatants.</p>

<p>This arrangement gave vast relief to the Coreys, who
had been thoroughly scared by the attack upon their
home, and it also relieved the minds of Buffalo Bill and
his pards, who disliked to leave the woman and children
exposed to the venom of the first outfit of red marauders
who happened to cross that way.</p>

<p>The scout accepted the hospitality of the rancher for
the night, and with his pards set off early next morning
on the trail of Price and Bloody Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Buffalo Bill&#8221; pleaded hard to be allowed to
accompany the scout, but was denied by his parents and
advised by the scout himself to remain to guard his
mother and sisters.</p>

<p>Suddenly awakened to a new responsibility in life, the
boy became the superior of his father in manly qualities.
Of perfect physical condition and good mental balance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
William F. Corey had been awakened by a crisis from
the slumber of youth to the cares of young manhood.
He realized the inefficiency of his father, who was
weakened by long illness and worry for the future of his
loved ones.</p>

<p>And the father, too, suddenly became aware that he
had a stout staff to lean upon.</p>

<p>Before the scout and his pards shook hands all around
and set off toward the Yellowstone, they were urged by
all to return, and the younger Avery declared that as
soon as he could arrange his affairs, so that he could feel
everything at home was snug and tight, he would gladly
give his services to the scout until the uprising should be
ended.</p>

<p>This offer Buffalo Bill said he might be glad to accept
later, and thanked his hosts for their kindness and hospitality.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF THE GULCH.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Waugh! What is this hyar percession, anyhow&mdash;er
march ter ther grave o&#8217; ther red man&#8217;s granddad, or er
Quaker meetin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad had broken the stillness after a long
silence as the scout and his pards made their way south
after crossing the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Buffler, hain&#8217;t sumpin &#8217;bout due ter drap? Ef
this hyar Hide-rack &#8217;u&#8217;d tumble down an&#8217; sling me erbout
four rod I&#8217;d git up feelin&#8217; better. I tells ye, this hyar
lack ov &#8217;citement&#8217;s gittin&#8217; on my nerves purty nigh orful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout had been riding silently, making a careful
study of his surroundings, and with the instinct of his
calling calculating on the possibilities of this wild country
as the site of a great battle.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse was in the lead, following readily the
trail left by Price and Ike in their flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; began the scout quietly, pulling
Bear Paw down to a walk and giving all the animals an
opportunity to puff, &#8220;that perhaps within the next few
hours we will find excitement enough to satisfy even
your cravings, Nick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s ther tork, Buffler! Hyar&#8217;s yer mutton when
yer needs timber fer sumpin ter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad stopped suddenly, having been interrupted by
a strange happening. They were now in a vast tract
of broken, well-nigh verdureless ridges, with here and
there stretches of sage brush and occasionally clumps of
stunted cottonwood or willow in the low places between.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Cayuse&#8217;s pinto had gained some distance on the other
horses, and, as the trim little Piute&#8217;s feather was disappearing
beyond a ridgetop, his companions saw his
arms suddenly thrown above his head, and instantly there
came a heavy report, accompanied by shaking of the
ground, and a cloud of smoke arose above the crest of
the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder, Buffler! Ther papoose is done for!&#8221;
yelled Nomad, driving the spurs to Hide-rack&#8217;s flanks,
and dashing ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Nick!&#8221; cried Hickok, sending his own
steed to the left sharply to reconnoitre the position, as
Buffalo Bill had instantly galloped away to the right.</p>

<p>If Nomad heard he did not heed, but, drawing his revolver,
he dashed up the ridge and over the crest at
whirlwind speed. But the trapper had barely reached
the highest point of the hill than there came the report
of two rifles, almost together, and the scout and Hickok
saw the brave old Nomad reel in the saddle for a moment,
then throw up his revolver, and bang! bang!
bang! as he plunged from sight down the other side.</p>

<p>Swinging into the gully between the ridges from different
directions, Buffalo Bill and the Laramie man were
puzzled by the fact that neither a man nor a horse were
in sight.</p>

<p>They rode toward each other, half expecting momentarily
to discover fragments of the bodies of Little Cayuse
and Navi. Where old Nomad had faded to was a
problem beyond solution at present, for he had disappeared
as if he had dropped from the face of the earth.
The sounds of firing had ceased, and not even distant
hoofbeats could be heard.</p>

<p>They rode toward each other rapidly, determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
reach some solution of the mystery, even at the expense
of disappearing as suddenly as their pards had done.</p>

<p>When barely ten rods separated them, both Buffalo
Bill and the Laramie man discovered that the character
of the geological structure had changed suddenly. Where
the ridges they had crossed in the last half day&#8217;s travel
had run in a general east-and-west direction, here they
were confronted by a series running the other way and,
as it were, becoming a part of the first formation, with
outcroppings of granite in the higher land to the south
of them.</p>

<p>Two of these north-and-south ridges approached and
butted into the long, high mound they had crossed, and
between them was a narrow and rapidly falling ca√±on
running away to the south, its walls ever growing
higher and more rugged and broken by sharp angles of
solid rock. The bottom seemed to be a bed of sand that
had washed in from the slopes above.</p>

<p>The first drop to the bed of the ca√±on was ten or
twelve feet, and there the sand plainly showed where
horses and men had plunged into it and then floundered
out and gone on.</p>

<p>Wild Bill was about to plunge his horse over the brink
in pursuit of his missing pards, when Buffalo Bill held
up a warning hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, Hickok,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you see where
the trail was mined at the head of the little ca√±on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and both Cayuse and Nomad went over the
brink here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they were not killed, or, at least, if they
were, they and their horses were dragged away in short
order. Now, figuring that they are both alive and in
their right minds, they are all the force necessary to follow
directly after these villains. There must be an outlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to this ca√±on somewhere, and when these fellows flow
out on the plains or into the bottom lands of some river
they are likely to turn to right or left in their flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I see your plan, pard,&#8221; said Hickok. &#8220;You
think it best for us to scout along the rim on either side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; here goes,&#8221; and the Laramie man dashed
away along what was then sometimes called a &#8220;hog-back,&#8221;
or long, low ridge of land.</p>

<p>The scout galloped down on his side, and the novel
chase was on.</p>

<p>Occasionally the scout or Hickok rode up to the edge
of the ca√±on and peered into it, hoping to catch a glimpse
of their pards or the fugitives.</p>

<p>For miles a stern test of the speed of their weary
horses was made, but they had not discovered hair or
hoof of the four men and four horses they believed were
galloping down the course of the dry gorge.</p>

<p>The only time lost was the occasional trip of one or
the other to the rim of the gorge to glance along its bed.</p>

<p>At sunset they seemed to have come out on a height
of land which fell off rapidly into a beautiful valley.</p>

<p>Tired horses plunged down the receding slopes of
the ca√±on&#8217;s sides, and soon Buffalo Bill and his pard sat
with the noses of their mounts together.</p>

<p>They had bounded the pathway down which the fugitives
and their own pards had fled. And over the green
and smiling grazing lands to the southeast of them for
miles there was not a moving thing the size of a coyote.</p>

<p>The scout slipped from his saddle and walked up the
gorge for a few rods.</p>

<p>Then he returned and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;They have not passed out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Hickok whistled. &#8220;What do you make of that?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they had not more than five or eight minutes&#8217;
start of us, and we have ridden hard; we may have
gained something on them in two hours&#8217; riding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct. Suppose we ride up the ca√±on a piece, and
then dismount, and give the horses a chance to blow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good notion, Hickok. I think we have those
fellows jugged. I am confident if Nick and Cayuse are
not too badly wounded that Price and his man will never
get by them. I should sooner think they would find some
favorable angle in the gorge where they are screened by
the rocks and make a stand, believing we are all behind
them in the ca√±on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we would have been if it hadn&#8217;t been for the
shrewd head of one W. F. Cody, in the service of Uncle
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout gave no heed to the praise of his pard, but
rode up the ca√±on, studying carefully the odd formation
and the opportunities for scaling the sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember our little climb in the ca√±on behind
Fremont&#8217;s Peak?&#8221; he asked of the Laramie man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I remember it? Why don&#8217;t you ask me if I remember
those lizards and the hair-raising yell of the
crazy man in the cave? I wonder if you remember the
greaser who knocked you over with a bullet and then
jumped into a hole a thousand feet deep? I think I do
remember some things about that trip, pard, and they
make me shudder every time they come to mind&mdash;especially
those crawly things and about ten million bats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good place to halt,&#8221; said the scout. &#8220;We are
hidden here from a straight half mile beyond, and can
rest, and eat a bite, and perhaps smoke a whiff, while
the game possibly walks into our trap.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Darkness dropped like a vast filmy blanket, and the
silent watchers heard only the impatient movements of
the horses, anxious to get back to the slope below the
ca√±on&#8217;s outlet, where the grass looked green and inviting.
At last the scout said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear, Hickok, that our plans have slipped up somewhere.
I think it would be well for one of us to take
the horses back to the grazing lands and the other stroll
up the ca√±on to see what has become of our pards. Perhaps
they were hurt worse than it seemed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the way I look at it, pard, and the one who
goes with the horses ought to remain near enough to
the ca√±on to keep informed as to who goes and comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, you look out for the horses, and I&#8217;ll see if
I can discover what has become of our pards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wild Bill Hickok soon had the horses hitched out
where they could graze upon the green, moist grass, and
then moved back where he could both hear the feeding
animals and any man or horse that should pass out of
the mouth of the ca√±on.</p>

<p>The scout had moved away in the darkness up the soft
bed of sand and gravel, on the alert every instant for any
sound of those whom he had expected to come that way.
But he was destined to be deeply disappointed and mystified,
for the light of another day revealed a state of affairs
wholly surprising.</p>

<small>NOMAD&#8217;S STRANGE WEAPON.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Little Cayuse rode from view of his companions
he had suddenly come in full view of a pair of
horsemen, leading two ponies, galloping down the gully
which opened at Navi&#8217;s feet. As the Indian youth looked
for the most favorable spot from which to make the leap
to the sand below, he discovered a fuse spluttering in the
dead grass and almost under Navi&#8217;s feet. Cayuse jerked
his heels to the pinto&#8217;s sides, and the little fellow bounded
ahead and over the brink just as the explosion came. At
the bottom both boy and pony were buried in the shower
of sand and gravel which followed the explosion, but
neither was injured.</p>

<p>As Cayuse and Navi scrambled out of the sand into a
settling cloud of dust which hid them from view and
probably saved both from becoming the target of the
fugitives, old Nomad burst into view over the crest of
the hill and through the smoke and dust.</p>

<p>Both the outlaws fired at the trapper, one pinking the
flesh at the point of his shoulder. But old Nomad had
been waiting too long for excitement to hesitate at the
first smell of powder. Driving the spurs to Hide-rack&#8217;s
sides without a glance at the trail he was taking, the
trapper found himself flying through the air, or, rather,
a veil of dust, to land in a heap with the surprised Hide-rack.
Over they went, the rider luckily escaping injury
from the flying feet of the excited and struggling horse.</p>

<p>By the time Nomad had regained his feet he could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Cayuse just rounding an angle in the wall fifty rods
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Hide-rack! Yip-yip-yar-r-r! Git out ov
it, ye heifercat! What ye rollin&#8217; round hyar in ther
sand fer? Ye hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter let thet aire red-blooded,
no-&#8217;count Navi beat ye, be ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hide-rack shook his head, and little sprays of sand
flew out from each ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ther stuff! Git ther sand outer yore ears, an&#8217;
mebbe ye c&#8217;n hyar me murmur. Mebbeso I mought shake
my head ef ther aujience don&#8217;t object, an&#8217; then I could
make out if theys any more explosions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Ther next time I goes in swimmin&#8217; I hopes
ther water won&#8217;t be so r&#8217;ily. Ugh! Gut sand enough
in my crop ter make er estridge boozy. Shirt feels &#8217;zef
&#8217;twas made er sandpaper. By ther tarnation ten spots!
I b&#8217;lieves ther pesky lead peddler teched me&mdash;ther&#8217; seems
ter be mud on thet thar left shoulder er mine. Howsomever,
I cyant bother &#8217;th thet when the&#8217;s more due
me an&#8217; er plumb good chanst ter c&#8217;lect up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Hide-rack! Don&#8217;t ye think ye better shake
yer heels er bit! Mebbe the&#8217;s sand in yer butes, &#8217;cause
why ye don&#8217;t ketch up ter thet redskin varmint down
front.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time Buffalo Bill and Hickok had discovered
the ca√±on, old Nomad had rounded the bend in hot pursuit
of the flying Navi.</p>

<p>Price and his partner were making the best time possible,
and apparently hoped to outstrip their pursuers. If
they knew the locality they could hardly have selected a
better place in which to traverse a long stretch of country
without the possibility of being observed from any
direction.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse was determined to keep the fellows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
view at any cost, and took long chances of an ambush
as he darted around sharp angles at the top of Navi&#8217;s
speed. Cayuse trusted to Pa-e-has-ka to do the rest if
he&mdash;Cayuse&mdash;could only perform the task he had been
given.</p>

<p>The Indian boy did not turn his head, but he knew that
Nomad was closely following, for he heard the trapper&#8217;s
cries of encouragement to his steed.</p>

<p>Cayuse&#8217;s black eyes shone as he patted Navi&#8217;s neck
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide-rack all same heap clumsy pile bones. No
ketchum Navi.&#8221;</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s hard riding in a straight-away stretch,
Cayuse saw the fugitives for a little while, and just as
they were approaching an angle one of the ridden ponies
fell. Both horse and rider rolled over and got up injured,
for both limped. They passed the corner out of
view slowly, and a moment later Cayuse saw a man
with a rifle come into sight again for a moment and then
jump back.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse halted and waited for Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t gittin&#8217; bashful, be ye, Cayuse?&#8221; greeted the
trapper.</p>

<p>Cayuse told what he had seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Le&#8217;s try &#8217;em out, boy. Ef they&#8217;s thar an&#8217;
see us make er dash &#8217;zif we&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter ride &#8217;em down,
they&#8217;ll like ernough try us er shot &#8217;fore we gits too nigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, go-o-o!&#8221; yelled Nomad, as they dashed
away at full speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yip-yip-yar-r-r!&#8221; he yelled, as they tore along.</p>

<p>The men in ambush heard the oncoming charge and
peered out. Then, as Nomad had predicted, they each
tried a shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet tells ther story, papoose&mdash;they&#8217;re thar an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
waitin&#8217; fer us,&#8221; said Nomad, pulling up and turning in
close to the wall where both he and the horse were
screened from reach of probable sniping. Little Cayuse
also pulled in out of range, and the two conferred.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve stacked ther cyards ergin us, pard,&#8221; said
Nomad. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use ter play when t&#8217;other feller
hol&#8217;s all ther trumps.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was decided to await darkness, now scarcely more
than an hour distant, and then attempt to steal up to
the enemy&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>Nomad had a plan for surprising the rascals, and he
proceeded to put it into execution, setting forth his intentions
to Cayuse as he worked. He began by taking
off his shirt and tearing a sleeve out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted Cayuse. &#8220;Nomad plenty crazy prairie
dog. Him cut off Hide-rack&#8217;s tail, mebbe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looky hyar, yer Piute papoose, ole Nick hain&#8217;t shot
so fur f&#8217;m ther mark uv common sense ez some little
Injuns I&#8217;ve seen, ner I hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter whittle off Hide-rack&#8217;s
tail, nary one. Ye see thet hoss needs &#8217;is rudder
ter steer with, but ole Nick don&#8217;t need this aire shirt
sleeve fer much er northin&#8217;, fur&#8217;s I know&mdash;&#8217;n it&#8217;s gittin&#8217;
whar et needs er soak in ther river, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty dirty,&#8221; observed Cayuse, whose disgust at
Nomad&#8217;s slovenly ways was proverbial among the pards.</p>

<p>Nomad tied up one end of the sleeve, and then began
filling it with sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap fool war club&mdash;kill &#8217;im easy?&#8221; asked Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, I hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter kill &#8217;im easy; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ter
fool &#8217;im &#8217;th this an&#8217; then kill &#8217;im good an&#8217; hard &#8217;th this
ole Nancy rifle er mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbeso him think rattlesnake,&#8221; suggested Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbeso him think &#8217;tis er fool Injun,&#8221; retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Nomad, imitating Cayuse&#8217;s voice, manner, and words as
he kept on with his work.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse improved the time in brushing the sand
out of his raven-black hair and re√´stablishing his shining
braids and feather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar, Cayuse, thar&#8217;s ther dyed-in-ther-wool ketchumnappin&#8217;,&#8221;
announced Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh? All same tie um round mouth make um stop
holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, is it a gag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See hyar, Cayuse; I don&#8217;t want no more o&#8217; yer insinooations
&#8217;bout my shirt bein&#8217; dirty. Mebbe thet thar
dummy&#8217;ll save yer er shot in ther &#8217;natomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Bullet heap better.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Cayuse suspected the purpose of old Nomad he
kept it to himself, and pretended to think the trapper
pard&#8217;s mind was wandering.</p>

<p>As darkness settled fast they completed preparations
by tying the horses to a jutting rock, then Nomad shouldered
his mysterious weapon and crept along close to
the inner wall. Cayuse followed near.</p>

<p>Nomad and Cayuse knew that if the men in ambush
suspected they were creeping along the wall a shot might
pot both of them, but they were taking the chances because
they were aware it was Buffalo Bill&#8217;s wish to recapture
Price and his partner in crime.</p>

<p>At any instant they might expect a flash ahead and
feel the sting of a bullet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>ANOTHER MYSTERY MET.</small></h2></div>


<p>For three hours Buffalo Bill plodded through the loose
footing in the dismal gully. The rim along both sides
was outlined against the heavens, but in the shadowless
realms between the high walls the darkness could be felt,
almost. The scout feared he might pass the men he was
seeking. On the other hand, if they attempted to escape
under cover of darkness he would stand two chances to
their one of hearing them first. He might pass them,
and he might walk into the very muzzle of their rifles.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scout paused and listened. He could
hear something moving a couple of rods ahead, so he
crouched low and waited. He hoped if it were men approaching
on horseback that he would be able, by looking
up toward the light of the sky, when they were near, to
discover who they were.</p>

<p>He heard the movements continued, but they came
no nearer.</p>

<p>At last the scout could curb his impatience no longer,
and began to make his way stealthily toward the sound.
Inch by inch he approached, lifting his feet noiselessly
and softly setting them down in the yielding mass. Then
he felt that he could almost reach the thing that was
causing the slight rustling; he discovered that it was a
pony.</p>

<p>Carefully reconnoitring the situation, the scout found
the animal was anchored to a point of rock and was
hungrily attempting to find a nip of green along the
wall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Passing this one, the scout came upon a group of
three others, their heads tied together in such manner
that they could proceed in no direction.</p>

<p>The scout believed that he had come upon the four
ponies of Price and Ike, and felt sure the human portion
of the sextette must be near. He determined to
ascertain, even at the risk of making of himself a target
for their bullets.</p>

<p>Pressing between the ponies, the scout struck a match,
and, so holding it behind the neck of one of the ponies
that it would not throw its light in his own face, he
scrutinized the place thoroughly for a rod or two.</p>

<p>He was behind an angle in the wall, and beyond that
perhaps the outlaws were hidden.</p>

<p>As the light flickered and went out, he caught a
glimpse of something that caused a chill to run down his
spine, and genuine grief touched his heart.</p>

<p>There beyond the angle, on the sand almost against
the opposite wall, lay the arm of a man&mdash;and Buffalo
Bill recognized the familiar stripes and colors of old
Nomad&#8217;s shirt.</p>

<p>Even Buffalo Bill for the moment was overwhelmed
by the catastrophe. His brave old trapper pard had gone
across the divide, as he had often wished to do, in active
pursuance of his duty. The scout feared, too, that Little
Cayuse had met disaster, as appearances would indicate
that Price was having matters all his own way, and from
some crevice in the rocks was awaiting opportunity to
wipe out others of the party in search of him.</p>

<p>Well, there was more than one could play at the waiting
game. The scout slipped behind the ponies, and
seated himself in the sand, his back against the wall.
He proceeded to make himself as comfortable as possible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>The ponies were tired, hungry, and uneasy. They
pulled each other about after a time, and attempted to
nose along the walls in search of water or herbage. The
scout remained quiet, with his ears strained for every
sound of interference by their owners, but no such sound
came to him.</p>

<p>The dreary hours passed, and the gray light of morning
at last began to reveal the nooks and corners of the
gully, yet the scout stirred not.</p>

<p>Presently he could see his surroundings distinctly, but
nothing indicated the presence of any human being other
than himself. The ponies were still pushing and pulling
each other in futile attempts at progress toward food and
water.</p>

<p>For half an hour the scout awaited the movement of
those whom he suspected were watching for him. With
ready revolver, he kept an eye constantly on the jutting
rock which marked the turn in the wall.</p>

<p>At last the critical moment arrived. He saw a slight
shadow which indicated the movement of some one beyond
the angle moving slowly up to it, and then just a
curve of a human face as it pushed slowly by the corner,
taking in every inch of the way as the eye swept around
the corner where the scout awaited with eye glinting
along his shining barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exclamation was one of surprise mingled with
relief.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse stepped into view and hurried toward
the scout, who arose quickly and extended his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared you had made your last trip with me, little
pard,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Me &#8217;fraid bad men get away. Keep eye on
rock all night, make um listen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;What happened to Nomad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep ketch um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Nick!&#8221; murmured the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Make um snore, scare pony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All same lie down, no put um head in bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Cayuse?&#8221; demanded the scout
somewhat sternly. He had begun to note the twinkle
in Cayuse&#8217;s eye, and failed to reconcile the Piute&#8217;s quiet
levity with the seriousness of the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mean Nomad heap tired; stick head in sand; mebbeso
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout began to have hopes that somehow his fears
had been groundless.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Cayuse,&#8221; he began, with a little laugh,
&#8220;what are you driving at? Hasn&#8217;t Nick met with an
accident?&#8221; And the scout advanced around the corner
far enough to view the grewsome relic lying against the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh; him fall down hole, git ears full sand; sand in
hair; sand in eyes; sand in nose&mdash;mebbeso eat um bushel
sand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Buffalo Bill, pointing at what
he had taken to be an arm of the trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nomad call it &#8216;ketchumnappin&#8217;,&#8217; me call um &#8216;fool war
club.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s spirits rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Nick?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over by Hide-rack. Him snore keep Navi &#8217;wake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now where are the bad men?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me go ketch um, find Pa-e-has-ka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they have slipped us somehow, unless Hickok<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
has done better than we have. But let us arouse Nomad
and see what he has to say about his &#8216;ketchumnappin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout and Cayuse approached the sleeping trapper,
who had rolled up against the wall near Hide-rack. The
horse was in no pleasant temper. He wanted grass and
water, and he had been hitched to a bare rock all night.
His head hung low, but he turned to look menacingly
with ears laid close, as his friends came near.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill began throwing sand at the ill-tempered
horse&#8217;s heels, and the latter responded with vicious kicks
and squeals as he danced about, aiming his steel-shod battery
at the scout and Cayuse.</p>

<p>Old Nomad reared up wildly from sound slumber,
waving his arms and shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa, thar! Consarn ye! Whut ye doin&#8217; ov, ye old
gander? Tryin&#8217; ter kick up er rumpus an&#8217; make me think
I&#8217;m bein&#8217; &#8217;tacked by thirty-leven Comanches an&#8217; fourteen
greasers all in er bunch? Quit it, ye ole heifercat,
&#8217;fore I fall on ye, tooth an&#8217; nail, an&#8217; smite ye, hip an&#8217;
thigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout laughed, and the trapper crawled out, cautiously
watching the light heels of Hide-rack the while,
and muttering:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears ter me thet hee-haw soun&#8217;s nachal. Hah!
Buffler! I might a-knowed &#8217;twas yore work, a-stirrin&#8217;
up ther varmint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing I want to know,&#8221; began the scout, &#8220;is
what that stuffed sleeve is for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trapper blushed behind his whiskers and the
grime of perspiration and alkali dust. But he recovered
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet thar is er surpriser. I planned ter creep up on
this side ther rock an&#8217; throw ther ketchumnappin&#8217; ercross
on t&#8217;other side, so&#8217;s ther vilyuns c&#8217;d hyar et. I reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
they&#8217;d fire at ther fust thing they heard move in the dark,
an&#8217; then, &#8217;fore they had er chanst ter think er git their
ears open, I jes&#8217; cal&#8217;lated ter jump round ther corner an&#8217;
nab um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t work,&#8221; grunted the trapper disgustedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you throw it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They throwed some consarned ball o&#8217; powder, an&#8217;
ha&#8217;r, an&#8217; stuff thet flared up an&#8217; showed my ketchumnappin&#8217;
sound ersleep. An&#8217; me&#8217;n Cayuse hed ter hedgehog
back inter ther darkness right lively, whilst they
wuz poppin&#8217; erway at us some cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t try it again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever wuth mentionin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve slipped our net, and they did it so neatly
that we don&#8217;t know how they carried it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pards returned to the angle in the wall, and at
last discovered that Price and Ike had scaled the wall,
probably early in the night, and had made away on foot
toward the southwest. By leaving their stamping ponies
to deceive the watchers they had made a clean and safe
getaway.</p>

<p>The pards now hastened out to the mouth of the
ca√±on with all the horses to join the Laramie man.</p>

<p>But once more they were disappointed. Wild Bill had
disappeared with both his own and Buffalo Bill&#8217;s horse.
They found where the animals had cropped the grass
for a time during the early part of the previous night.
Now, out on the broad plain as far as the strong eyes of
the scout or of Cayuse could reach, there was no sign of
man or beast in any direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>The scout was puzzled. Something had happened of
importance to draw Wild Bill from his post of duty.</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s first business, however, was to allow the
horses to graze, then he would move on toward a river
which showed like a silver thread in the greenish-brown
plain in the distance.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill believed it must be the Big Horn River,
but he had never been in this part of the country before.
He was impressed by the magnificence of his surroundings.
He had visions of broad, cultivated fields, peaceful
herds, and busy villages in this beautiful expanse where
now roamed the Indian, the buffalo, and the coyote.
The very immensity of it all impressed him. And yet he
knew that beyond the threadlike river the grazing lands
rapidly degenerated into the barren shale and useless
acres of the Bad Lands, where only sage brush and cactus
grow, and these of a sickly sort.</p>

<p>The wonders of irrigation were then unborn for the
West.</p>

<small>HICKOK OUTWITTED BY A THIEF.</small></h2></div>


<p>Sitting silent as a spectre, listening to the grubbing
teeth of the horses a few rods distant and for the sound
of any approach down the gully on the other side, Wild
Bill Hickok observed a ball of fire shoot up into the
southern sky in the distance. It burned brightly for a
moment and then disappeared. Immediately far in the
east another sprang up, and then the west responded,
but to the north Hickok could not observe over the
higher land.</p>

<p>The Laramie man knew this to be some sort of Indian
signals, but of course could not pretend to understand
their meaning.</p>

<p>Shortly the signals were repeated, this time much
nearer on all sides. The significance was that the country
swarmed with redskins, and that he was in the centre
of a vast tract on which there were an outer and an
inner circle of hostile outposts.</p>

<p>Hickok became absorbed in his surroundings, and wondered
why he and Buffalo Bill had not discovered some
evidence of these war parties when they had studied the
plain before night. He decided that the surface must be
more uneven than it looked from this commanding position.
He heard only the occasional snarl of a prowling
coyote and the whispering breeze in the dead husks of
the weeds.</p>

<p>And then he suddenly realized that he no longer heard
the grubbing of the horses. He listened intently for
some moments, but if the horses were still there they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had satisfied their hunger, and were quietly enjoying the
rest after a hard day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>From the gulch came no sound, and at last the Laramie
man stole cautiously down toward the spot where he
had left the horses. He found the place easily enough,
but both animals were gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is odd, not to say mysterious,&#8221; muttered Hickok.
&#8220;I never had a horse slip his lariat before.&#8221;</p>

<p>He searched for the pins, and at last found one&mdash;with
a short piece of the riata still attached. He felt of the
end&mdash;<i>it had been cut</i>.</p>

<p>The Laramie man clinched his fists in silent fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sneaking red thief has crawled right up under my
nose and stolen my horse and Buffalo Bill&#8217;s,&#8221; he ground
between his teeth.</p>

<p>To think of retaking the horses was next to a hopeless
task. Perhaps they had been gone half an hour&mdash;long
enough for an Indian to have led them beyond hearing
and then galloped several miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Cody think?&#8221; was the thought uppermost
in Hickok&#8217;s mind. &#8220;He&#8217;ll think I went to sleep and let
the redskins get away with the horses without so much
as &#8216;by your leave.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the plainsman&#8217;s mind was settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring those horses or I&#8217;ll never come back,&#8221; he
said in a low tone, for all the Laramie man&#8217;s determination
was aroused.</p>

<p>He tore the lariat pin from the ground, pulled the
piece of rope from the pin, and stuffed it into his pocket.
He then searched for the other, found it, and served it
in the same way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t leave those telltale things behind,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>At first Hickok attempted to pick up and follow the
trail, but in the heavy pall of darkness he found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
impossible, as he knew beforehand it would be. Then
he started toward the nearest point where a signal light
had flared. He proceeded carefully, aware that at any
moment he might blunder upon a group of silent savages
in the grass. Once a whirr at his side caused him
to bound away from a cactus, where he had disturbed a
rattler.</p>

<p>Frequently he stumbled in the open doorways of
prairie-dog villages, and at another time a wriggling
thing under his foot felt as large as a cat. It was probably
a bull snake, which, cloyed with its early evening
meal, had been taking a nap in the pathway of the lone
plainsman.</p>

<p>After probably two hours of this, Hickok seemed to
have reached the rim of a little valley, for there, seemingly
far below him, were the twinkling fires of an Indian
encampment.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here is where they were beginning a Fourth-of-July
celebration,&#8221; thought Hickok. &#8220;Very good; we&#8217;ll
slip down that way and see what they&#8217;ve got besides fireworks.
Mayhap they&#8217;d enjoy some firecrackers and a
little parade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hickok approached the encampment with exceeding
caution. He wished to locate the ponies of the warriors,
for he had no doubt it was a war party, to see if his
horse and that of Buffalo Bill had arrived.</p>

<p>He made an entire circuit of the camp, so near that
he could hear the sentries greet each other in low, guttural
phrases.</p>

<p>Again he began the circuit, this time within the circle
of the guard. On his previous trip around the camp he
had crossed a small stream. When he came to it again
he turned down its bank and approached within three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
rods of the nearest fire. There he saw a dozen warriors
sleeping in their blankets and one sitting with crossed
legs, smoking and staring into the embers.</p>

<p>Hickok crept noiselessly past the fire, and followed the
stream. It was as he had hoped&mdash;below the camp on
the little stream were the horses. They had grazed along
the bank, and now were huddled together in groups of
three or four with crossed necks and heels outward, a
trait which seems to have been handed down from the
days when the wild mustangs thus grouped themselves
for defense against the snapping wolves that came to pull
them down.</p>

<p>Hickok carefully worked among the ponies, but found
no trace of the animals belonging to himself and Cody.
He successfully passed the sentry, and once more found
himself on the open prairie.</p>

<p>He decided, as it must be well along past midnight, to
seek some good hiding place before dawn, and there remain
during the coming day. He had food, and water
was at hand. He thought the stream might furnish
dense thickets farther down, and so followed it, coming
to a sharp turn where the brook tumbled over the rocks
to become part of a river twenty feet below.</p>

<p>Hickok thought he had come to the Big Horn, but
later learned it to be only a good-sized tributary of that
wildly picturesque river.</p>

<p>On the bank near the junction the plainsman entered a
dense motte of small timber. He knew he was well beyond
sound of the Indian camp, and was screened from
view by the sharp hill he had descended. So he started a
little fire, and made a dipper of strong tea. By the light
of the fire he prepared a hiding place by weaving the
willow sprouts and sage brush into the thick growth
about a spot he had selected for the purpose. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
carefully about for signs of snakes among the rocks, but
found none.</p>

<p>His nest ready for the coming day, the Laramie man
ate heartily, smoked a pipeful of tobacco, and lay down
to rest just as the first streaks of dawn began to show
in the east.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Hickok awoke, refreshed
and ready for action. He had slept the sleep of
the weary man who is in perfect physical condition. The
proximity of his warlike neighbors had not troubled his
dreams. He was sorry to have caused his pards anxiety,
but this could not be helped, and there was no use crying
over spilled milk.</p>

<p>He arose and carefully reconnoitred his position before
leaving the thicket. Then he moved to the edge of
the timber, and looked across the plain in all directions,
except to the northwest, which was hidden by the higher
land.</p>

<p>Selecting the largest cottonwood which grew in the
loving embrace of a willow, he clambered up where he
could look over the brow of the ridge.</p>

<p>A surprise awaited him. The Indian encampment had
quadrupled in size. The little valley looked like a village
of a large tribe.</p>

<p>But a sight that stirred him more was far out on the
plain to the westward. There he first saw a madly galloping
cluster of horsemen. There were half a hundred
Sioux making all haste to the westward, as if life depended
on covering the ground at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>Hickok instantly picked out two of the larger animals
in the lead, and knew them to be the gallant Bear Paw
and his own brave horse. He looked for the object of
this wild flight, and saw, far away, a herd of buffalo
crossing a ridge toward the sinking sun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud. &#8220;To-night
they&#8217;ll gorge themselves with buffalo meat and celebrate
the event. Now, I can see where Hickok gets in his fine
work and lights out with a couple of good horses&mdash;or
gets a tickle of bullets in his ribs in the attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Laramie man remained in the tree for an hour,
watching the chase, and, when the surprised buffalo
finally found themselves surrounded by yelling redskins,
their pitiful attempts at escape and their maddened
charges on the enemy were almost useless.</p>

<p>Hickok clambered down, and once more inspected his
grub bag. Another little fire provided tea, and as the
sun was going down behind the distant hills he again
climbed the tree and watched the procession of returning
hunters.</p>

<p>The night settled overcast and as dark as Erebus. The
Indian fires burned up in red glare, and many signals
were sent up, evidently telling other encampments of the
rich haul of the party that day.</p>

<p>It was an ideal night for the work Hickok had in
hand; the darker the better, and he felt in prime condition
for the undertaking. He saw that his revolvers
were loaded and in the best condition, and then filled his
water pouch, for he knew not when he would again find
the thirst-relieving liquid. His knife was keen.</p>

<p>Two hours after dark the feasting and dancing were
under way. The red warriors provided meat for some
time to come, indulged in much speechmaking, and one
chief aroused great enthusiasm. Hickok did not know
this man, and could not well get near enough to hear
what he said&mdash;too many fires were burning, and the odor
of cooking meat was wafted out to him, telling that the
feasting and revelry would last throughout the night.</p>

<p>Hickok knew where to find the horses this time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
had no trouble in passing the guard, who was all eyes
and ears for the camp.</p>

<p>But the first difficulty to overcome was an extra guard
that had been posted over the stolen horses. These were
apart from the ponies, probably because Bear Paw absolutely
refused to associate with the Indian mustangs,
and he usually emphasized his dislike in a way that made
it unsafe for the smaller animals.</p>

<p>The two horses were lariated on the bank of the little
stream opposite the others and farther from the camp
fires. This was fortunate in itself for the Laramie man,
but the Indians had taken the precaution to post a separate
sentry by them.</p>

<p>The buck sat with his face to the firelight a few feet
from the horses. He was smoking and now and then
mumbling to himself, probably disgruntled comments on
his ill luck at being unable to partake of the night&#8217;s festivities.</p>

<p>In their anxiety to begin the sport the Indians had
given their ponies scant time to graze, and the latter
were out of temper and quarrelsome. They bit, kicked,
and squealed in a continuous hubbub. This noise assisted
the Laramie man to carry out his plan.</p>

<p>He crossed the brook, and crept silently toward the
unsuspecting guard. From behind clumps of sage he
picked out his way, and crawled nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>The buck was viciously sweeping the weeds about him
with the muzzle of his rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll vent your temper a bit presently,&#8221; thought the
Laramie man, creeping nearer and ready for a spring at
the slightest turn of the Indian&#8217;s head, which was outlined
against the firelight beyond.</p>

<p>A silent bound, a dull thud, and the buck rolled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
without a moan. The Laramie man&#8217;s revolver butt had
descended true and hard.</p>

<p>Hickok acted quickly. He cut the lariats of the horses,
hitched Bear Paw&#8217;s line to his own saddle, and was just
swinging into the saddle when there was a surprised
&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; behind him, a shot, and Buffalo Bill&#8217;s right
bower darted out upon the plain like a whirlwind, with
the whole Indian encampment behind him in wild turmoil.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>IN THE SIOUX CAMP.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill examined the ground closely where he
and Hickok had tethered the horses the previous evening.
He went over the ground inch by inch in search of
a clue to the cause of the Laramie man&#8217;s disappearance.
He knew that only some extraordinary occurrence would
have called Hickok from the place before his&mdash;Cody&#8217;s&mdash;return.</p>

<p>At last he found one of the hitch pins where Hickok
had thrown it, several rods from the space the horses
had grubbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is rather peculiar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
why Hickok should have thrown the pin away, and if it
was the work of Indians I don&#8217;t see how it came here
unless the horses were scared, and jerked the pins from
the ground, and dragged them till they fell from the
lariats. And again there are no tracks of horses in this
direction, nor did the horses kick up any soil, as they
would have done at the start-off, if frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued his search patiently, and was rewarded
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I have the key. Here is a moccasin
track in a sandy spot, and close beside it the imprint
of Bear Paw&#8217;s barred shoe. I think some thieving
red saw us put out the horses, and after dark sneaked up
and quietly led them away. It is evident that Hickok
discovered they were gone and has attempted to follow
them in the night, although what he expected to accomplish
in the darkness is more than I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;Trust Hickok ter know what he&#8217;s erbout, Buffler.
I&#8217;m er-gamblin&#8217; ther&#8217;ll be things er-happenin&#8217; &#8217;mong ther
redskins ef Hickok don&#8217;t git er whack et them thar
hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse had been following the trail left by the horses
as they were led away, and from fifty rods away he
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear Paw go all same rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way?&#8221; called the scout.</p>

<p>Cayuse pointed to the west.</p>

<p>&#8220;That pesky Price an&#8217; &#8217;is pard went that way, too,&#8221;
suggested Nomad. &#8220;Mebbe Hick&#8217;ll meet up with ther
varmints an&#8217; square &#8217;counts with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the scout, &#8220;that we had better let the
ponies graze for an hour or so and then make back into
the ca√±on and wait for darkness and Hickok.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve hit ther nail fust time, Buffler. One er two o&#8217;
us mought be takin&#8217; er nap right now ergin er time o&#8217;
need. I feels et in my bones thet thar&#8217;s doin&#8217;s er-comin&#8217;
our way good an&#8217; plenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good logic, old pard. You and Cayuse go up
the gully a short distance and catch a wink while I watch
the ponies. I want to study the country for a while this
morning, and I&#8217;ll take first watch. After the animals are
satisfied I&#8217;ll lead them in out of the way of prying eyes
and take a snooze myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse objected to Cody&#8217;s taking first watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me no squaw,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a jugful,&#8221; assented the scout, &#8220;but we want
you to be at your best to-night. I think there is an Indian
encampment near, and after dark I want you to
wiggle into it and find out all there is to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian boy was pleased at the scout&#8217;s evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
confidence in him, and submitted with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The scout had hoped by a careful study of the plain
to discover some evidence of the location of the encampment
which he believed must be near, and he was not
disappointed.</p>

<p>Scarcely an hour had passed before he saw a large
party of horsemen far to the south moving westward.
They came into view now and then as they passed over
the higher points of the rolling plain. He saw them
quite distinctly as they forded the river, and then for a
time they disappeared, to come into view again after half
an hour, showing that they had crossed quite a respectable
valley.</p>

<p>Again they went over a ridge, and were seen no more.
The scout decided that the party had either stopped in
this valley or that it was so broad that the horsemen
were beyond reach of the human eye when they reached
the far side.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; he said aloud, as he arose to collect the
lariats of the ponies, &#8220;we&#8217;ll move down into that country
and see what we may discover.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was dark when the scout awoke, and for a time
he could not think where he was. Then he remembered
finding Nomad and Cayuse sleeping in the gully, and
that he had tied the ponies together, and sat down in the
shadow of the precipitous wall to wait a while before
awakening either of his pards.</p>

<p>He now recalled guiltily that he had slept at his post.
He moved over to where Nomad and the Piute had lain.
Both were gone. He groped his way to where he had
left the ponies, and they, too, were gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one on me,&#8221; chuckled the scout. &#8220;The pards are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
giving the ponies a chance to graze, and are letting me
have my nap out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka sleep plenty sound,&#8221; said Cayuse at his
elbow.</p>

<p>The faithful Piute had remained by the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Nomad?&#8221; asked Cody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him go fill um up ponies,&#8221; answered Cayuse.</p>

<p>They found Nomad readily enough where he had been
since sunset. He had found a buffalo wallow and had
given the horses all the water they wished. They had
grazed their fill and were now enjoying a rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s strange doin&#8217;s off west&#8217;ard, Buffler,&#8221; said the
trapper, who sat on the ground smoking and observing
the changes in his surroundings as night advanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Nick?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; exclaimed the trapper. &#8220;Thet&#8217;s what&#8217;s up.
They&#8217;ve been er-shootin&#8217; up them air rockets ever sence
&#8217;twas dark ernuff ter see um, an&#8217; &#8217;way off in ther south
ernother passle o&#8217; ther varmints hev been answerin&#8217; ov
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>The signals were coming up in the direction Buffalo
Bill had seen the party disappear in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I thought,&#8221; said the scout. &#8220;There is a
large war party over yonder; I saw them go there this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Buffler, this &#8217;mences ter look like life was
wuth livin&#8217; er dyin&#8217;, ary one. Snarlin&#8217; catermounts! I
feels et in my ole bones thet ther fur&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter fly &#8217;fore
these sage brushes git ter be plum trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be off,&#8221; said the scout quietly, selecting the best
pony by going among them and feeling of their heads
and ears for intelligence and their bodies and legs for
endurance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>&#8220;Better turn the other two loose, hadn&#8217;t we, Nomad?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore we don&#8217;t want no extra hosses ter bother with&mdash;them&#8217;s
my notions,&#8221; answered the trapper.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill removed the lariats from two of the
ponies, and giving each a sharp slap sent them scurrying
out on the plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll get a good rest and take on fat before
the Indians pick them up,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The scout and his party struck the valley to the northward
of the encampment, and came to the little stream
which Hickok had found the previous night. In a thicket
they left the horses and moved down toward the
twinkling fires.</p>

<p>When near enough they saw that it was a special occasion
in the camp, and they kept close to the stream because
of the growth along its banks. They saw the
dancing, and heard the shouting of the warriors, and
then they drew near enough to discover that it was the
celebration of a successful buffalo hunt.</p>

<p>For some time they watched the animated night scene,
and Cayuse was just stealing away intending to enter the
heart of the camp to hear what was the gist of the
harangues, when there was a commotion only a few rods
from them down the stream, followed by the report of a
rifle.</p>

<p>Instantly the scene in the camp changed from riotous
hilarity to one of consternation and excited inquiries.
Everywhere there were shouts and running about.</p>

<p>The scout heard the pounding of horses&#8217; hoofs, and
then out on the plain came a taunting laugh, followed
by a shout in a well-known voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you yowling devils, if you wish, but I bid
you a cheerful good night!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;Wild Bill!&#8221; ejaculated the scout and Nomad in a
breath.</p>

<p>There was scurrying to the ponies, and a yelling mob
rode off in pursuit, but soon gave it up and returned.</p>

<p>By the time the excitement was over and explanations
made, Little Cayuse had wormed into the heart of the
camp, had donned a Sioux headgear and blanket, and
stolidly sat with some of the elder warriors as they
smoked and awaited the speeches of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Cayuse understood enough of the Yankton Sioux
tongue to follow the trend of comment, and his presence
seemed to arouse no suspicion.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill remained concealed in the thicket by the
stream, and awaited events, and events came all too
rapidly for comfort.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pards heard a dull thud and a grunt behind
them, and realized that an Indian had jumped the
stream, and was coming through the thicket directly upon
them.</p>

<p>The scout touched Nomad as a signal to remain quiet,
while he half arose.</p>

<p>As the Sioux&#8217;s next step would have brought him in
contact with the scout, the latter straightened to his full
height and grasped the red&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>The Indian was large and powerful, and though taken
wholly by surprise put up a tremendous fight. He could
not let out the warning yell that gurgled in his throat, but
the sound of the struggle in the small growth attracted
the attention of a group of bucks at the nearest fire.
Snatching up brands, these fellows ran to investigate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snarlin&#8217; catermounts an&#8217; ther ring-tail heifercats,
Buffler, ther hull kerboodle&#8217;s bruk loose kerwallop!
Knock ther red on ther head an&#8217; git yer guns!&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout bent his antagonist backward, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
blow of his fist put the savage temporarily out of commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back across the brook, Nick, and then leg it up river
to the horses!&#8221; he said, crashing through the brush and
leaping across to the thick growth on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>For Nomad it was hard to resist a volley at the oncoming
reds, but orders were orders when they came
from Buffalo Bill, and he bounded after his leader.</p>

<p>The Indians plunged into the thicket and found the
buck just regaining his senses and yet unable to comprehend
his condition. A few paused to question him, while
others scurried about in the willows, looking for some
sort of enemy.</p>

<p>The scout and trapper made good time up river, but
suddenly saw outlined against the sky, on the bank above
them, several horsemen. Instantly they crouched low
and waited. To continue up river they must pass almost
at the feet of these horsemen who seemed to be waiting
for them or else watching events below.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all about us, Nick,&#8221; whispered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh!&#8221; returned the trapper. &#8220;One on &#8217;em got his
goozelet squoze till I&#8217;m gamblin&#8217; he cyant chew buffler
gravy ter-night, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The torch bearers were coming nearer along the
stream, apparently having discovered the tracks the pards
had made in jumping across.</p>

<p>Then from above them came a guttural query in a
shout to those beating the bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;He asked what the fuss was about,&#8221; whispered the
scout.</p>

<p>The pards could make out seven men on horseback,
for the other five were grouped about two of them, and
it could be seen that both the latter wore hats instead of
feathers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Then one of the men spoke to the other in good English:</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like our finish, Ike, down in that gang of
red cutthroats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Price!&#8221; whispered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Bloody Ike,&#8221; added the trapper.</p>

<small>CAYUSE SENTENCED TO DIE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Straight out upon the plain, Hickok, astride his own
horse and leading Bear Paw, fled. He had little fear of
being overtaken, and soon discovered that the Indians
had missed his course entirely and were passing south of
him. He decided to circle northward and go back to
the mouth of the long gully, in the hope of learning
something of his companions.</p>

<p>Nearing- the stream again, some distance above the
Indian camp, the Laramie man was suddenly startled by
a shrill whinny, and he instantly knew it to be the call
of Navi to his friend Bear Paw.</p>

<p>Wild Bill jerked up the heads of his horses so suddenly
that both desisted from the response which they
were ready to give.</p>

<p>The Laramie man made haste to investigate, and so
confident was he that no other pony could imitate the
neigh of Navi that he took long chances of running into
an ambuscade. Wild Bill was a man who was ever ready
to take chances if anything was to be gained thereby.
If there was but one in a thousand he would take that
one&mdash;and Wild Bill&#8217;s &#8220;luck&#8221; was phenomenal.</p>

<p>The horses made straight for the copse where the scout
and pards had hidden their animals. Hickok dismounted,
and looked over the horses to discover who was paving
the Indian camp a visit. Then he laughed to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;So Cody came on an Indian pony, and without a
saddle. Must be Price&#8217;s animal. Wonder what they
have done with Price and Ike while the entire family of
pards is away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>Hickok now heard greater commotion toward the
Sioux camp and saw bucks running with firebrands
toward the fringe of cottonwood along the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! I guess some of the pards have missed a step
somewhere,&#8221; mused the scout. &#8220;Perhaps I had better
drop down that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>To think was to act with Hickok. He left the horses
with the others and hurried away, hoping to connect
with his pards. He felt sure that if Buffalo Bill or any
of his comrades had been discovered and were making
a getaway that they would naturally follow the timber
to the spot where they left their horses.</p>

<p>Hickok came to a little bluff that ran down sharply
to the brook and was about to clamber along its base
to the thicket beyond when he discovered that its summit
was occupied by several mounted men.</p>

<p>The Laramie man paused. To pass over the open
space might expose him to the full view of those above
at any moment, should a torch suddenly flare above
the thicket. Yet he had no doubt some of his pards
were hiding in the brush and perhaps confronted by
the same dilemma.</p>

<p>Hickok chuckled as a scheme presented itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps those fellows think they are going to sit
there, like a turtle on a log, till the harvest moon, but
I doubt it,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>He hurried back until he was on the other side of
the bluff, and had the horsemen outlined against the
light of the fires beyond; then he quickly but quietly
climbed up behind the group, one of whom was shouting
to those with the torches.</p>

<p>Hickok heard a white man speak and recognized the
voice of Price. He had crept to within a scant rod of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the heels of the ponies, whose heads were drooping after
a long run.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hickok launched himself on hands and feet
at the very heels of the ponies, emitting at the same
time an uncanny cross between a bark and a growl and
switching vigorously at the animals&#8217; heels with a long
withe he had brought for the purpose.</p>

<p>The effect was surprising to the riders, to say the
least. They had no sooner heard the slight rustle behind
them than they were startled by the mad snarling
that might have been made by a half dozen catamounts
and a grizzly or two thrown in. Then their
ponies nearly leaped out from under them in a mad
dash to get away.</p>

<p>The frightened mustangs dashed down the hill,
plunged across the stream, and, before the surprised
torch bearers could guess at what was happening, some
of them were bowled over by the stampeded ponies.</p>

<p>In the midst of the hubbub, Wild Bill gave the signal
of the pards from the top of the mound. Instantly he
was answered by the scout from the ravine, and a
minute later the pards had clasped hands and with
Nomad were hurrying toward the hiding place of the
horses.</p>

<p>When well beyond earshot of the redskins, Nomad
turned on Wild Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;See hyar, Hick, I don&#8217;t want you never ter dew
northin&#8217; like thet ergin. Ov all the caterwaulin&#8217; lunkumsluices,
an&#8217; snarlin&#8217; molwallopuses thet ever scared
a Injun&#8217;s hair white, yer ther plumb wust. Why, when
thet thar tarnal kihootin&#8217; begun I thort er sidehill
lounger, w&#8217;th feet ez big ez bundles o&#8217; hay, hed bruk

us. What d&#8217;ye mean by such kerryins on, anyhow,
Hick?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout and Hickok were laughing quietly at old
Nomad&#8217;s badinage, and the trapper wound up with:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so mightily scart thet I plumb fergut ter leave
my address with ther feather pates. Cyant seem ter
git over thet yowlin&#8217; nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Cayuse?&#8221; asked Hickok, when they had
come up to the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s er-callin&#8217; on ther big Injuns,&#8221; answered Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better wait here a while for Cayuse,
and then if he doesn&#8217;t come we&#8217;ll take his pinto with us
and leave the odd pony for him if he shows up here
after we are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way do you intend to move?&#8221; asked Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the long gully is about as satisfactory as
any,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can beat it, and right under the Indians&#8217;
noses,&#8221; said the Laramie man. He then described the
place where he had passed the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good grazing and convenient to water?&#8221; asked the
scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have another plan, then,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Name it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Nick take all the horses and repair to your
castle and I will await Cayuse. I am anxious to know
what is the object of all this chin music.&#8221;</p>

<p>At midnight Cayuse had not returned, and the scout
once more approached the encampment, having some
misgivings regarding Cayuse&#8217;s escape. He feared the
daring boy had been overzealous in his work and had
fallen into the hands of the red warriors. Cody realized
that on such occasions as this a prisoner would receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
short shrift at the hands of these red men on the way
to war.</p>

<p>The scout wished to learn where Sitting Bull himself
could be found. He did not expect to find the famous
chief with this war party, but farther south; but hoped
Cayuse would learn much from the conversation of the
chiefs and the harangues of the silver tongues.</p>

<p>Were Sitting Bull present Buffalo Bill would not
hesitate to walk boldly into camp. But the scout did
not care to take a long journey to the presence of the
chief in the company of the red men. He did not like
their food or their manner of serving it.</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously the scout worked nearer the
fires, where the festivities were going on as if there
had been no break. Confident in their numbers and
knowing that no strong government force would be
in that part of the country, they cared little for the
annoyances of prying settlers who might come to seek
revenge for the loss of stolen stock or the murder of
a family.</p>

<p>Suddenly before the scout the tall form of an Indian
appeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>The scout would have sprung upon the red man to
check any outcry, but was halted by a whispered word:</p>

<p>&#8220;Long Hair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good&mdash;how?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian extended his hand and the plainsman
grasped it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How!&#8221; he said, &#8220;White-man-runs-him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does Pa-e-has-ka walk into the arms of the red
foe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To learn why the red man is a foe.&#8221; Buffalo Bill
answered quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;The red warriors gather because they have been
robbed,&#8221; said the Crow trailer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are murdering and plundering innocent
people who know nothing of treaty rights, as they go
to join their chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka knows that there are no dead Indians on
the white man&#8217;s ground, but there are many dead white
men on the Indian&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true, because even when the red brother comes
on the white man&#8217;s land to steal he is forgiven, but when
the weak white man goes to the red man&#8217;s hills to dig
gold or to the red man&#8217;s valleys to raise corn, he
is slain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka knows the Indian agents keep good
blankets and give us bad; they feed good meat to the
white children and rotting bones to the red papoose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And because a white rascal steals from the red men,
the dusky warriors turn and slay innocent white squaws
and little babes. White-man-runs-him, if the red warriors
do not turn back and await a peaceful settlement
of the dispute, it will mean the death of hundreds of
both red and white men, and nothing will be gained.
Who is in command of this party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rain-in-the-face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Sitting Bull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big Horn Ca√±on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this force going south now to join Sitting Bull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till the snows run into the rivers again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the red warriors going to do till then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make the white man sorry he came to the red man&#8217;s
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you lead me to the camp of Sitting Bull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, Pa-e-has-ka&mdash;there are many white brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to warn. Does Pa-e-has-ka remember the beautiful
knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian pulled the shining pearl-handled blade
from its sheath, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since Pa-e-has-ka gave knife to his red brother, me
swear to be friend to palefaces, always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will White-man-runs-him lead me to the
tent of Sitting Bull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the moon hides its face again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian was interrupted by a commotion among
those about the fires. There was a scurry and much
running about, followed by shouts and then hideous
yells.</p>

<p>The Crow warrior listened and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch spy&mdash;mebby torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout grasped the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find out for me,&#8221; he said earnestly and sternly, &#8220;if
it is a Piute boy. If it is, it is Pa-e-has-ka&#8217;s loved pard,
and he must be saved if Pa-e-has-ka has to give his
own life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me come back,&#8221; said the Crow, and moved away
swiftly.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill awaited impatiently as the minutes lengthened
into hours.</p>

<p>At last there was a slight rustle and White-man-runs-him
appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;All same so many prisoners,&#8221; he began, holding up
three fingers. &#8220;So many palefaces&#8221;&mdash;holding up two
fingers&mdash;&#8220;and so many Piute boy&#8221;&mdash;one finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Palefaces have paper talk from Sitting Bull, no die
yet. Piute die at stake when sun looks over hills.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE RESCUE OF LITTLE CAYUSE.</small></h2></div>


<p>In four hours it would be daylight, and, as the sun
appeared above the eastern hills, the Indian celebration
was to have its climax in firing the pile of dry wood
that was to torture Little Cayuse.</p>

<p>The scout had heard the words of White-man-runs-him,
and his jaws snapped together with a grim determination
to save his little pard&mdash;but how?</p>

<p>In the war party were several hundred well-armed
and well-mounted warriors. In many cases their rifles
were superior to those of the white soldiery, for agents
were in Canada and the East, buying the latest long-range
arms.</p>

<p>To endeavor to take the prisoner forcibly would be
suicidal, foolhardy. But the scout would make some
attempt&mdash;that was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill left the trailer and moved about the
camp. He studied it from every point of the compass,
learned the exact lay of the land in all directions, and
then went down to the junction of the stream and river
where Hickok and Nomad were snugly hidden. He told
them of the prospective fate of their little Indian pard,
and a plan he had partly perfected.</p>

<p>The scout hoped that within the next hour or two the
enthusiasm of the red men would wane and that many
of them would go to sleep. Then it was that he proposed
to mount Bear Paw, move as far into the camp
as possible, and then charge through among the fires
like a whirlwind, snatching the tied-up Little Cayuse as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
he went. Once on the plain, with Bear Paw uninjured,
he would laugh at pursuit.</p>

<p>It was a desperate undertaking, with small chance of
success, but if any one could do it, that man was the
daring Cody, the peerless rider, and he was aware of
his chances.</p>

<p>Hickok and Nomad were to be ready, out on the
plain, leading Navi, to check the first mad rush of pursuit,
and then wheel in behind the scout for a long run.</p>

<p>Every man talked as if the attempt were to be a complete
success, but in his own mind each foresaw the
grim possibilities of failure.</p>

<p>Nomad thought a better chance of winning lay in a
triple charge, two of the riders shooting right and left
among the Indians, while the third snatched the prisoner,
and made off.</p>

<p>Hickok had a still different plan and one that appealed
strongly to the scout. It was for a stampede of
the Sioux ponies just as Buffalo Bill was making his
daring dash, and confuse the red men by an attack
in two quarters at once. This plan had the advantage,
also, if successful, of delaying pursuit.</p>

<p>The scout decided that all had best ride out on the
plain to the eastward and get ready for the attempt,
which should be made an hour before daylight.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill made one more reconnaisance of the
camp and managed to learn the exact location of Little
Cayuse, lying like a bundle of wool in the firelight, near
the tepee of Rain-in-the-face; then he went back to
his companions and everything was made ready.</p>

<p>This was the plan: Hickok was to remain near the
pony corral, which was on the stream below the encampment.
At the signal, he would attempt to stampede
the herd across the stream and out on the plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to the southwest. The scout and trapper were to ride
out to the east of the camp, where Cody would begin
his cautious approach. At the moment he put the spurs
to Bear Paw, he would emit a wild yell, and plunge
among the fires and sleep-dazed Indians. At the same
instant old Nomad would begin a mad dash along the
outside, shooting and yelling like a fiend, also heading
for the west side of the stream, where both would fall
in with Hickok. If the latter succeeded in stampeding
the ponies, all the pards would devote themselves to
scattering the animals.</p>

<p>Well out on the plain, the three pards were quietly
discussing the situation and prospects. In two hours
the darkness would begin to lift. In one hour the attack
must be made.</p>

<p>While they talked in low tones the quick ears of the
scout detected a sound farther out on the plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;some one is approaching on
horseback. I heard a horse snort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Passing Bear Paw&#8217;s rein to Nomad, the scout made
his way quickly and noiselessly in the direction of the
supposed intruder.</p>

<p>Three horsemen were approaching cautiously, apparently
studying the twinkling camp fires, which could be
seen in the lower valley. They were coming directly
toward him, and Buffalo Bill crouched low and awaited.
He knew that when near enough he could distinguish
white from red riders against the light of the sky.</p>

<p>Then &#8220;sh! sh! sh!&#8221; he hissed, and the three horses
were pulled up sharply and a voice said, in a low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, Avery,&#8221; said the scout, moving up to the side
of the latter&#8217;s horse. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big war party of Indians
and they are all alive. Who have you here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Little Buffalo Bill&#8217; and a big coon, who calls himself
Skibo, and says he is your pard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the scout. &#8220;I am glad to see you
all. He shook hands with the delighted colored man,
and the no less pleased boy, William F. Corey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am heartily glad to see all of you, but you have
arrived at a time when you ought to be miles away,
especially if your horses are tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are fresh,&#8221; declared Avery, &#8220;for we rested
five hours since dark and came to investigate this firelight.
I expected &#8217;twas Indians, but I hoped it might
be you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to come?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the negro came along, desperately anxious to
connect with you, and wouldn&#8217;t give me no peace till I
agreed to try to follow your trail. Then the lad
wouldn&#8217;t give me no peace till I agreed to let him come
along&mdash;so here we are, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve done my part in findin&#8217;
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one chance in ten thousand that you ever found
us. But time flies, and our plans are to be carried out,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>He briefly explained the situation and the plan of
rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I help?&#8221; asked the boy eagerly, &#8220;I brought
my bugle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you blow the call?&#8221; asked the scout, seized with
a new idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; uncle says I can do it as well as an army
bugler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! my boy, you shall perform the lion&#8217;s share.
I will revise my plan. Hickok shall proceed as arranged
before. I will creep down the brook to the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
encampment. The bugler shall be posted out from
the northeast side, Avery to remain with the bugler and
give off commands in a loud voice. Nomad and Skibo
are to go to the southeast side near the river, and when
the bugle sounds they must shout loud commands to imaginary
soldiers and gallop along the front with all the
clatter possible. While this is going on Hickok will
start the horses, and I will rush into camp and release
Cayuse. In the excitement of expectant attack the ruse
will work without a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout now felt so certain of victory that he was
almost jubilant. Over it all was the glamour of the
gamble with death, which the war horse feels in battle.
Every man of the party was on the raw edge of foolhardy
daring. They would rescue the faithful little
Indian pard if they had to fight Sitting Bull&#8217;s entire
force of braves.</p>

<p>The critical moment came at last, and to the boy from
Avery&#8217;s ranch had been allotted the honor of opening
the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could this youngster perform his part?&#8221; that was
the question the scout asked himself.</p>

<p>Most lads would have been unable to blow out a candle
at such a tense moment, and Buffalo Bill realized the
tremendous nervous strain upon one so young, but he
knew the metal of this lad was of far different quality
from that of the average boy.</p>

<p>The scout had crept down until barely thirty feet
separated him from the dying embers of the nearest fire.
About it were grouped a score of braves, some smoking
and wearing out the hours of darkness, others asleep
with heads curled on crooked arm.</p>

<p>Near the tepee of the chief the fire also had sunk to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
few glowing coals, but the scout could make out the
form of Little Cayuse, and a couple of guards near him.</p>

<p>On the lower side of the field, braves were setting a
post and bringing fuel for the torture pyre.</p>

<p>The scout tightened his belt, and looked to his revolvers.
He was ready.</p>

<p>Then the still air of the early morning quavered in
the clear, far-sounding notes of the bugle, and across
the plain rang the &#8220;Forwar-r-d! March!&#8221; in stentorian
tones. Again, far to the southward of the bugle call
came other hoarse commands and the sound of galloping
horses.</p>

<p>The Indians sprang up and darted hither and thither
in consternation. Everything was in confusion.</p>

<p>Some of the braves kicked out every ember of fire,
for that would make targets of the red men to the
white soldiers beyond.</p>

<p>At the same moment pandemonium broke loose among
the ponies. There were yelps, barks and screams, and
the jumping, snorting and squealing of frightened mustangs.
Away they scurried, and the dazed braves offered
little resistance.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill bounded in among the Indians, and, in
the darkness and their demoralized state, they knew
not but that he was one of them. He found Cayuse, cut
the Piute&#8217;s bonds, and lifted the boy to his feet, when he
heard a startled grunt at his elbow.</p>

<p>Like a flash the scout wheeled and sprang sidewise, in
time to avoid a vicious drive from a knife. He whipped
out his own blade, and steel met steel. The Indian was
Buffalo Bill&#8217;s own height and a powerful fellow, agile
as a cat, and skilled in the use of the weapon in hand.</p>

<p>The tumult about them and the gloom prevented instant
discovery by the braves at hand. One buck came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
near enough to see the struggle and sprang at the scout
with a tomahawk, but he met a club from Little Cayuse,
who was now on his feet, that stretched him out.</p>

<p>Like tigers the scout and his antagonist lunged and
parried, the steely muscles of the scout pressing the
other back, yet neither sure of himself, because of the
darkness.</p>

<p>In avoiding a terrific thrust, the scout stepped back,
caught the red man&#8217;s blade on his own, and as the brave
came on of his own momentum, almost into Buffalo
Bill&#8217;s arms, the latter shot a quick blow with his left
fist that caught the red on the point of the chin, and
the battle was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, Cayuse,&#8221; said the scout, as he bounded
over the fallen Indian. But before he had covered ten
feet he sprang almost into the arms of three or four
warriors coming that way. It was too late to turn back,
and like a battering-ram the scout shot ahead. His arms
worked like piston rods, and the surprised Indians fell
before the onslaught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Cayuse,&#8221; he called, and darted out the way
he had come. Cayuse was at his heels as they came
to the brook.</p>

<p>A little farther up they found Bear Paw and Navi
tethered, and a moment later Avery and the boy, followed
by Hickok and old Nomad, galloped up.</p>

<p>The scout remembered the lone pony hitched in the
bushes near by, and released the animal, which followed
them as they raced away after Hickok.</p>

<p>Wild Bill was having the time of his life, out on the
plains, with the herd of Indian ponies darting like
mad things before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When ther redskins wake up they&#8217;ll wonder whar
we come from an&#8217; whar we went,&#8221; chortled old Nomad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
&#8220;On&#8217;y one trouble w&#8217;th that, Buffler, &#8217;twarn&#8217;t long ernuff.
Ef we c&#8217;d er hed &#8217;bout twenty-four hours jes&#8217; ez
excitin&#8217; mebbe the&#8217;d been some sassifaction in et.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! Mars&#8217; Billyum, Ah reckon dey t&#8217;ought de
reg&#8217;lars am right at de back doh, w&#8217;en dey hear dis

dar, yer goor fer nuffin&#8217; brack possum eaters!&#8217; Dat&#8217;s
what Ah said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill, after they had come
up with Hickok, &#8220;don&#8217;t fool yourselves with the notion
that it is all over but the shouting, for it isn&#8217;t. It is
almost daylight, and we are on the open plain with three
hundred throughly aroused red men on our trail as soon
as it is light enough to see. It is up to us to put as
much distance between ourselves and the Indians as possible
before light. To the west lies a heavy range of
hills, which we ought to make in three hours&#8217; hard riding.
Are you all good for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; came the chorus.</p>

<p>When the sun arose the scout&#8217;s party had passed quite
a range of hills, and if the Indians were in pursuit they
were nowhere visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef the&#8217;s ary game I like ter play at, et&#8217;s er hide-an&#8217;-whoop
scramble with ther reds,&#8221; piped up Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty whoop,&#8221; suggested Cayuse; &#8220;some hide, more
fight. Pa-e-has-ka all same catamount&mdash;everywhere
and nowhere, hit like grizzly, kick all same Hide-rack,
Injun think um heap bad medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did yer hev er beauty fight er gittin&#8217; ther papoose,
Buffler?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there were one or two got in the way, but they
were so scared they couldn&#8217;t fight,&#8221; answered the scout
modestly.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<p>&#8220;Shore; ther pesky varmints wor so scairt they prob&#8217;ly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>

like them air Sioux,&#8221; sarcastically snapped the trapper,
because the scout made so little of his exploit.</p>

<p>To turn the conversation, Cody said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good place to make an attack and I move
we make it&mdash;on our haversacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; sang Hickok, &#8220;I second the motion.&#8221;</p>

<small>BUFFALO BILL SAVES TEN.</small></h2></div>


<p>During the darkness and excitement of the expected
attack, while the Sioux were pulling themselves together,
the prisoners were forgotten. Price managed to slip his
bonds, and released Bloody Ike; not that he had any
particular love for the ex-miner, but because misery
loves company, and rogues cling together in adversity.</p>

<p>The pair found some blankets and arms, and mingling
with the braves worked down the stream until they came
to the motte of timber at the river bank. They preferred
to remain prisoners among the Indians to being
captured by the soldiers, which they momentarily expected
to charge on the Indian encampment.</p>

<p>The Indians, too, believed that U. S. Cavalry only
awaited daylight to charge. That explained why the
red men had failed to follow Cody and his party.</p>

<p>Scouts were hurriedly sent out to investigate the position
and number of the enemy, and reported that they
could not find any troops. Daylight revealed the great
plain, instead of bristling with U. S. soldiery, as barren
as the evening before.</p>

<p>The Indians were mystified. They had heard the
bugle call, the giving of orders, and the galloping of
officers&#8217; horses. Spies, too, had been in the camp by
the dozen, according to the reports of those who had
come in contact with Cody, and the ponies had been
stampeded and scattered over the plain.</p>

<p>The Indians felt great relief that the army had vanished,
but they held a superstitious presentiment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the paleface riders and walkaheaps might drop from
the clear sky, or arise out of the ground at any moment.</p>

<p>Braves were sent out to round up the ponies, and a
council of the chiefs decided that it would be better
to move to the hills and find some spot where such a surprise
would be impossible.</p>

<p>Price and Bloody Ike hid in the timber until they
heard the Sioux move away; then they came out and
searched the camp ground for food. Some pieces of
buffalo meat were found and broiled over the coals, and
eaten without salt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty tough lug for you and me, Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike growled his discontent. He felt that if he had
refused to mix up with Price he would not be in such
desperate circumstances. To be landed in the middle of
a hostile country, with nothing but enemies on all sides,
was no joke. To be there without a mount was doubly
serious.</p>

<p>Although the distance to the hills looked short, these
men knew that it was a long and tiresome journey to
those unfamiliar with pedestrianism.</p>

<p>Price noted that the Sioux traveled in a southeasterly
direction; he decided to proceed west, hoping to be able
to find a remote ranch, from which they could steal food
and horses. Almost any horse would be a relief from
this leg-wearying march.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that late that night two tired
and hungry men, searching for a hiding and resting place
among the bluffs and gashes of the ever-changing hills,
came over the rim of a basin, to see a cheerful fire at its
bottom and a group of men sitting around it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; almost shouted Price. &#8220;A party of gold
seekers, who have crossed from the Black Hills. They
are prospecting these hills and are no doubt well supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with provisions and horses. Perhaps we can annex&mdash;with
your knowledge of mining and my knack of
tickling human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safer to steal it and keep away from these fellows.
If they lose a couple of horses and some duffle, they&#8217;ll
lay it to the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this doesn&#8217;t look like an easy place to sneak out
of, with a horse attached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, but in that case we&#8217;d better annex the
grub, an&#8217; wait for a better show. If ye mingle with
these fellows it is just so many more who know where
we are, and if any soldiers meet up with them and ask
for you, they&#8217;ll connect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Ike, but I&#8217;m so hungry I don&#8217;t believe
I can wait to make a good steal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me. You stay up here in the rocks
an&#8217; chew your boot leg, while I go down to look things
over. I hope I get a grab at the powder supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bloody Ike crept over the rocks and around the pitfalls
of the broken buttes, and slowly made the descent
toward the flickering camp fire. He wondered how
horses ever had been landed where he could see them
beyond the fire. In his opinion such horses must have
wings. Ike, himself, had no flying machine, and he was
minus much cuticle from his head to his heels.</p>

<p>The ex-miner was weary and half famished, and with
the slipping and sliding among the jagged corners he
would have looked, in daylight, like a candidate for a
hospital. He was &#8220;Bloody&#8221; Ike, indeed.</p>

<p>But he was bent on mischief, and determined to accomplish
it. He cared naught who these men were, or
what they represented&mdash;it was their food he was after,
their horses, if possible, and last, but not least, their
powder, if they had any.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>He crept close to the peaceful camp where ten men
sat around a cheerful blaze, smoking their pipes and
relating stories of the trail and the mines. The party
was made up of Buffalo Bill and his pards, Avery and
the boy, and three miners with whom the scout had connected
in the foothills. The miners were glad to meet
English-speaking men, after several months in the wilds,
where the only human beings they had seen were Indians.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was glad to avail himself of the knowledge
these men had of this part of the country.</p>

<p>The rock-bound fastness of the camping place recommended
itself to him as a headquarters while in that
part of the world, and combined good water supply and
grazing for the horses, where they could not be stampeded.
The miners had six mounts, and had improvised
a trap at the only entrance to the high-walled &#8220;dip,&#8221;
where a horse could enter or depart.</p>

<p>A man could scale the cliffs, if he had his nerve with
him, but no animal with hoofs, unless it be a mountain
goat, could expect to enter or leave by any other source.</p>

<p>In other ages great clefts of rock had dropped from
the cliffs above and formed dark caverns and numerous
hiding places, where one familiar with them might defy
an army to dislodge him. Here the miners had arranged
their lodges and had little fear of attack by Indians.</p>

<p>As Bloody Ike stole nearer and nearer, he gasped with
surprise. He recognized Buffalo Bill and some of his
pards. Several times in the past he had made use of
the most devilish means he could devise to put them out
of the way, and he had yearned for one more opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! for his powder and fuse!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>But there might be a chance&mdash;he could see shovels and
picks leaning against a rock near the fire. Some of
these men must be miners and if so they would be apt
to make use of powder or explosive in some form.</p>

<p>Ike was near enough to catch some words of the conversation
when the men arose, knocked the ash from
their pipes, and going back under the side of a great
leaning rock, rolled in their blankets and said good
night.</p>

<p>For a time&mdash;a long time, it seemed to him&mdash;Ike
waited until he felt sure the men were all asleep, and
then he began a quiet investigation of the place on his
own hook.</p>

<p>The fire had sunk away to a few embers, the flickering
blaze from which cast fantastic and dancing shadows
on the rocks and walls. Indeed, the stealthy figure
might have been mistaken for a part of the fitting picture
painted by the fire gods.</p>

<p>Ike found food and regaled himself and stuffed his
pockets for his guilty partner on the rim above&mdash;and
then, &#8220;Eureka!&#8221; Here were two cans of blasting powder&mdash;and
a fuse! a big coil of it!</p>

<p>A devilish plot began to form in the abnormal gray
matter of the bad man&#8217;s brain.</p>

<p>Here were some of the men he hated most; here were
stores of provision and good horses. In this stronghold
he and Price could hide until search for them should be
exhausted&mdash;if there were none having a prior claim&mdash;and
here, at his hand, were the means of jumping the
claims of those who came before and taking possession
of all.</p>

<p>How easy it would be&mdash;all that seemed necessary was
to attach the fuse&mdash;so; and place the keg under the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of this pile of rocks&mdash;so; and softly pull some of them
into a position around and on top of it&mdash;so.</p>

<p>The mass of loose stones and blocks of granite, that
had been cleared from the almost level floor of the
camping place, lay in just the right position to be hurled
in their deadly mission, full upon the sleeping men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, how easy it would be!&#8221;</p>

<p>All he would have to do would be to find a match in
his ragged pocket&mdash;scrape it lightly over his trousers
leg&mdash;so; and apply it to the end of the fuse.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, his nerve had always stood him in good stead&mdash;when
he lighted a fuse he always stood over it after
other men had fled, to see that the fuse was well fired
and not going out.</p>

<p>How easy! It lighted the first time! It was running
splendidly! He had cut a generous length of fuse to
give him ample time to get well beyond the terrific
concussion, which would follow in a few seconds.</p>

<p>He must go.</p>

<p>With the agility of the experienced mountaineer he
darted over the rocks, caught up the other can of powder
and some of the provision bags, and sprang away into
the shadows and disappeared among the rocks.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was restless. He was not given to visions
or presentiments, and did not believe in forerunners;
but when a decaying molar got its tantrums and began
to put in the kicks of a wild horse, it disturbed his slumbers.
He bore the pain as long as possible and then
crawled out softly, that he might not disturb his companions.</p>

<p>The scout had determined to try the solace of his pipe.</p>

<p>As he approached the almost lifeless coals of the evening&#8217;s
fire he was surprised to see a man arise from the
dense shadow of a pile of rock and dart away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>He at first thought it was one of the miners, but the
apparent haste and stealthy step aroused the scout&#8217;s suspicion.</p>

<p>He stepped along and peered behind the rock pile to
see if there might be others.</p>

<p>He saw only a little sparkling point of light that
would hardly have burned a baby&#8217;s finger.</p>

<p>But the scout stared in horror for an instant, then
bounded over the rocks like a madman.</p>

<p>He tore at the spluttering spark with his bare hands,
but it was already beyond the grasp of his fingers under
the rock pile.</p>

<p>It was crawling away rapidly, its single baleful eye
snapping defiantly at its pursuer.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill plunged his hands among the rocks and
tore them away with insane fury.</p>

<p>He hurled them right and left, at the same time shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn out, boys! Get behind the rocks! A blast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he came to the powder can. He felt its rim,
and he saw the fatal spark, but where the fuse was attached
he could not see.</p>

<p>He grasped the can with both hands and ripped it
from its surroundings.</p>

<p>The sputtering light clung to it.</p>

<p>Like lightning he raised the can above his head and
threw it far out over a chasm that yawned a rod away.</p>

<p>A roar and blinding flash in mid-air told how near
the scout had been to being too late.</p>

<p>The concussion threw him and others who had jumped
up at his shouts, from their feet. But no one was
injured.</p>

<p>Torches and lanterns were lighted and a search of the
camp begun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the work of Bloody Ike, the powder fiend,&#8221; declared
Hickok, and the others agreed with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has got away with your other can of powder
and the coil of fuse,&#8221; said the scout to the miners.</p>

<p>&#8220;And every can of that powder is worth a small
fortune, &#8217;way out here,&#8221; mourned one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose there was a devil bad enough, in
existence, to attempt to kill ten men in cold blood,&#8221; said
Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s Ike Pelletier, who once handled the explosives
in the Bridger range mines, he&#8217;d murder a regiment for
a hundred dollars. And I&#8217;d give twice that to get next
to him for a few minutes,&#8221; said Avery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the scout, &#8220;I am convinced that he is in
this basin now&mdash;he can&#8217;t be far off, for I saw the man
who lighted the fuse running away&mdash;and we must hunt
the villain down and see that he pays the penalty for
his crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all right from your standpoint,&#8221; said Avery.
&#8220;You represent the law. But I represent justice swift
and sure, with no chance for a slip-up. If I see Ike
first, you will never take him back for trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see him that day at the surveyors&#8217;
shanty?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw both men, but I didn&#8217;t recognize either of
them, yet I thought the one with whiskers resembled
some one I had known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have a bullet for him, there must be a story
behind it?&#8221; suggested one of the miners.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, but it is too long to tell to-night, besides,
we&#8217;ve got to capture the scoundrel.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Bloody Ike reached the top of the basin, where
Price was waiting impatiently, and consumed with curiosity,
he was out of breath and unable to express his
feelings, but he shook his fists, waved his arms, gasped
and choked in impotent rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get any grub?&#8221; asked Price.</p>

<p>Ike pulled bread and meat from his pockets.</p>

<p>Price fell to and kept his mouth so full that he could
not ask questions until Ike had had opportunity to regain
his wind.</p>

<p>Ike&#8217;s first words indicating a state of reason, after a
broadside of oaths and imprecations hurled in the direction
of the lights which could be seen moving about
down below, were:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we hide among the rocks somewhere until they
give up the chase?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never give up the chase&mdash;who do you suppose
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffalo Bill and his pards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse than that; Buffalo Bill is ten devils and a
million imps when he is on a man&#8217;s trail, curse him.
I&#8217;ve tried over and over again to blow him to kingdom
come, and he defeats me every time. He bears some
sort of a charmed life and it&#8217;s no use for me to buck
up against &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8220;What was the blow-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A can of blasting powder that ought to have lifted
the whole bunch of them into next week, but that long-haired
representative of Uncle Sam and the hot place
jumped out just in time to see the fuse, dig the can out
of the rocks and throw it into a chasm before it exploded.
Oh! if it only had gone off in his hands, instead
of three seconds later!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty bold thing to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse him, yes. He isn&#8217;t afraid of man or devil, and
it is his everlasting readiness to act and take the chances
that wins. If I&#8217;d been ten seconds later he&#8217;d probably
pumped me full of lead, into the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad man to buck up against; I&#8217;ve found that
out, Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I said we&#8217;ve got to get out of this place, and
the sooner we go the better&mdash;are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way shall we go&mdash;out across the plain again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! no. They&#8217;ve got horses and would pick
us up as soon as light. We&#8217;ve got to stick to the mountains,
where a horse can&#8217;t go, and keep out of sight&mdash;and
keep going. I&#8217;d rather have old Split-hoof, himself,
on my trail than Buffalo Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t live in these mountains long&mdash;there isn&#8217;t
so much as a catamount to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go hungry, then, for I&#8217;m going to keep
as far from Cody as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have got a new appreciation of the
scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d have, if you had seen him lift that can
of blasting powder above his head when he was expecting
it to go off every second, and throw it farther than
I could throw a ten-pound weight. I tell you a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that&#8217;s got nerve and strength like that is too many
for Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, lead the way; I feel better after eating,
but I&#8217;m so tired and sore I can&#8217;t go fast or far. I wish
you&#8217;d got hold of more grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, and a can of powder, and started with them,
but when I saw Cody dig out my blast and throw it away
I lost my nerve and dropped everything. I knew then
it was no use for me to try to do him, and all I thought
of was getting as much space between me and him as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are gone bad, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Price.</p>

<p>The pair clambered away over the rocks, slipping and
sliding in the darkness and muttering bitter anathemas
because of their misfortunes.</p>

<p>In their case, as in all others, the way of the transgressor
is hard. If the hardships are not physical and
apparent to the world, they are mental, and the one who
defies the laws of God and man is undergoing torture
which he is too great a moral coward to admit. The
right way is not only the best way, but the easiest way,
and if reward does not come in dollars and cents, it
comes in the satisfaction of knowing that one has done
his best.</p>

<p>Price still held to his nerve, while Ike&#8217;s had been
shattered by one incident&mdash;the demonstration of a brave
man that he has no fear to do right, whatever the consequences.</p>

<p>Price was suffering physical torture and readily admitted
it to his partner in crime, but he had not weakened
to a degree that would cause him to admit, even
to Bloody Ike, that he feared for the future, other than
for its physical discomforts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; cried Ike, who was in the lead, suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
He clung to a stunted evergreen and saved himself from
plunging down a dark chasm, which yawned at his feet.</p>

<p>But his warning came too late for Price, whose tottering
condition sent him headlong.</p>

<p>As he felt himself going into the black depths below,
the former Indian agent and gambler, who had bled
more tenderfeet than any other bad man of Bozeman,
uttered a wild cry of despair.</p>

<p>But Price&#8217;s last hour had not come. After a fall of
not more than ten feet he landed in a deep pool of ice-cold
water, and went down, down, till his head seemed
bursting before he reached the top again.</p>

<p>Gasping and thrashing about, calling wildly for help,
and begging Ike to save him, Price raised a pitiful howl
that irritated Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make more noise than a gang of scared young
ones,&#8221; said Ike. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t shut up I won&#8217;t bother
to pull you out. Buffalo Bill&#8217;s gang can hear you all
over the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Price continued to plead, and, striking a match, Ike
was able to see his way down the rocks to where he
could reach his struggling companion.</p>

<p>That ended their journey that night, for Price absolutely
refused to proceed in the darkness. He was
shivering and exhausted, his teeth chattering and his
courage ebbing out with his strength.</p>

<p>Ike groped about until he found a gash in the gully
they had been pursuing, where a thick growth of stunted
spruce and fir had found footing. In a pocket in the
rocks he started a fire and Price hovered over it in an
attempt to warm his body and dry his clothing.</p>

<p>Ike lay down to sleep, and declared with half-suppressed
anger that he didn&#8217;t care what happened.</p>

<p>Standing over the fire, until he choked from the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of it, and slapping himself to increase the blood flow,
Price almost fell over and his knees knocked together
from some cause other than cold, when a voice beside
him said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indian agent cold now; be hot enough in next world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&mdash;who&#8217;re you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me White-man-runs-him, friend of honest palefaces;
hate thieves and liars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Buffalo Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him greatest man in world; him white friend of
red men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh; him in mountains; mebby find white cutthroats,
take um back to be hung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For how much money will you take us out of here
and show us the way to Laramie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me not trade with white thief. Buffalo Bill take you
Laramie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I would give you one hundred ponies, wouldn&#8217;t
you get us out of this place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much as the red man loves these hills and plains, he
would not sell his services for it all, to the white thief
who stole the lives of squaws and papooses,&#8221; and the
stern red man waved his arms to signify all around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you procure us food for money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the red chief had the rotten meat you have given
his red brother, he would sell it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; cried Price, attempting to awaken pity in the
heart of the Indian, &#8220;I shiver and die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the red chief had the rags you have given his
braves for blankets, he would burn them that the sight
might rekindle the fires in the paleface robber&#8217;s blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Price said no more, but held his trembling hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the feeble blaze and waited. All his offers were spurned,
and he knew that any further appeal would be useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go, paleface dog,&#8221; said the Crow trailer, &#8220;but I
shall come again, and your paper lies shall hang over the
same fire and shrivel, and squirm, and burn with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Buffalo Bill where I am!&#8221; gasped Price
feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffalo Bill&#8217;s heart too big and soft. Sioux warriors
hate the agent with the forked tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian vanished and Price sank down by his little
fire, broken and disheartened. In a short month he had
come to this from a position of importance in a respectable
community. Then he spent money right and left
and lived in luxury, with henchmen to do his bidding;
now he was freezing, starving, and men of all races
turned their hands against him.</p>

<p>When Bloody Ike awoke at daylight, Price told him of
the visit of the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the red sneak has gone after a posse of grunters
to capture us. I hope we are taken by a different party
than the one which nabbed us before; perhaps then your
pretended letter from Sitting Bull would go again,&#8221; said
Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this White-man-runs-him seems to be awake
to the trick, for he said &#8216;paper lie&#8217; would burn with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me! if they are going to talk fire before they
take us, I, for one, am not going to be taken easily. The
sooner we get out of this part of the country the better.
We had better keep to the rocks as much as possible,
so the trailers can&#8217;t follow us. And another
thing we must remember, is to keep well down in the
gullies and dark places, where Buffalo Bill&#8217;s party can&#8217;t
see us, if they are on the watch from the heights.&#8221;</p>

<p>At mid-forenoon Price was exhausted and unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
stagger any farther. So they descended into a deep
ca√±on where the gloom at that time of day was like
evening, and there found a brook and in it sizable grayling.</p>

<p>They had neither hook nor line, but by damming the
brook, at a narrow place above, Price and Ike allowed
the water to run from a pool below and then picked up a
bounteous roast of the little fishes.</p>

<p>The prospects of relief from hunger somewhat cheered
these fellows, who were getting a foretaste of torment,
even before they had departed the terrestrial sphere.</p>

<p>Both men became quite cheerful as they hastened up
the gully in search of material that would acknowledge
the influence of fire.</p>

<p>They found some dry-kye and pitchy knots, which
promised a fire that would seem friendly and at the same
time cook the precious little pile of fishes.</p>

<p>As they made their way back to the spot chosen for a
camp ground, and from whence their smoke could
not be seen in any direction, they were quite cheerful,
and chatted together in low tones, for they had not yet
overcome the fear that enemies were lurking near.</p>

<p>But when they came to the opening in the rocks what
a surprise and disappointment awaited them.</p>

<p>A large grizzly bear sat munching their fish with
apparent approval and satisfaction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>A SUCCESSION OF SURPRISES.</small></h2></div>


<p>It was agreed to leave two of the miners to guard the
camp and horses, and that the other eight should set out
in search of Price and Bloody Ike. Little Buffalo
Bill was to go with the scout; Avery and Hickok went
in another direction; Nomad and Cayuse took up the
search together, and Skibo and the third miner made
up the fourth party.</p>

<p>It had been decided to thoroughly scout that portion
of the mountains and if possible &#8220;put the kibosh&#8221; on
the pair of rascals who were not only a menace to any
community, but a pest when turned loose in the wilds,
preying on man and beast, without mercy and in most
dastardly manner.</p>

<p>The miners were delighted at discovering their other
keg of powder and the bags of food stuff where Ike had
dropped them. The cost of packing, food, tools, and
powder into this wild territory was disheartening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall Ah do wiv dem human alligators, if Ah
comes up to um in de mountings an&#8217; dey &#8217;fuses ter be
brung in, Mars&#8217; Billyum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use them as you did the bull at Cooley&#8217;s ranch&mdash;take
them by the horns and twist their heads off,&#8221; interrupted
Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them in, Skibo, if not alive some other way,&#8221;
answered the scout quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! dat&#8217;s what Ah will, Mars&#8217; Billyum; if Ah
gets one o&#8217; dem lily-white han&#8217;s ob mine onto um. Dat&#8217;s
what Ah will, Mars&#8217; Billyum.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind the color of the hands, so long as they
are honest,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s my sentiments,&#8221; piped Nomad.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to see, the four parties
were searching every nook, and in accordance with
Buffalo Bill&#8217;s orders, were making as little noise and disturbance
as possible. This was observed for the double
purpose of hiding their movements from the men they
were after, and to avoid attracting the attention of stray
bands of Sioux, who might be in that territory.</p>

<p>The scout and young Corey made directly west into
the heart of the hills. The boy was in the seventh
heaven of the real thing in happiness. To have been
selected as the companion in this man hunt, by the famous
scout himself, was honor enough for one boy.
That Buffalo Bill chose the lad because he wished to
see that no harm came to him, did not occur to the boy.</p>

<p>The scout found the wiry legs and toil-hardened body
of the boy could stand the hardships of mountain climbing
as well as any man. Indeed, young Corey bounded
from rock to rock with the agility of a monkey and was
as sure of his footing and as fearless.</p>

<p>Unlike most boys, whose faces are shining with happiness
and whose minds are overflowing with enthusiasm
for the work in hand, young Corey was quiet and
almost wordless except when a question was addressed to
him by the scout.</p>

<p>Cody liked this trait&mdash;it was the inherent strong point
in the character of a good scout.</p>

<p>It was a delightful day in the cool, breezy hills. The
air was laden with life-building ozone, and fairly pungent
in its light and bracing purity.</p>

<p>The scout, himself, felt the joyous effect of the day
and companion. What whole-souled man can say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he does not enjoy the presence of a clean, pure-minded
youth? And Buffalo Bill always loved strong, wholesome,
brave, and honest boys. He thoroughly liked this
manly chap and determined to see that he was returned
safely to his parents and sisters.</p>

<p>They paused for lunch, where a little mountain stream
eddied listlessly in a sandy-shored basin, in a rock-bound
gulch. It was cool and shadowy there, with the
odor of the pines and other evergreens which eked out
a stunted existence on the almost bare rock.</p>

<p>The boy had produced a fishhook and line and
caught a fine string of trout and grayling, and these
were broiled over glowing coals, to be seasoned with salt
and pepper from the scout&#8217;s pocket case.</p>

<p>Can a boy imagine anything more delightful than
camping in the open with a man whose daring exploits
are being read by the whole world?</p>

<p>Any boy might expect an adventure at any moment
from the very love of adventure to get in Buffalo Bill&#8217;s
way. And to young Corey it came with such suddenness
as to almost take his breath away.</p>

<p>After eating, the scout stretched out in the sun to
seek council with his pipe, and the boy could not resist
the temptation to once more try the trout. &#8220;Perhaps
I&#8217;ll get a few for supper,&#8221; he told the scout.</p>

<p>He had caught several trout and was trying to lure
a big fellow from a gloomy retreat under the side of a
rock, when the boy felt instinctively the presence of
danger. He glanced up and his eyes were fascinated
by what he saw.</p>

<p>Not fifteen feet away was a mountain lion, with eyes
fixed upon him, and his whole sinuous body in motion,
with the appearance of a cat about to spring upon a
bird.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The boy&#8217;s rifle lay by the camp fire, but his revolver
was in his belt, and his hand moved swiftly toward it.
Then he remembered that Buffalo Bill had said they
must make as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>He would not fire a shot, even to save his life, for
had not Buffalo Bill, in substance, ordered otherwise?</p>

<p>He drew his sheath knife, gripped it firmly, strained
every muscle to resist the shock that he knew was soon
to come, and awaited the spring of the panther.</p>

<p>The animal rocked its body from side to side, worked
its claws in and out as its feet caressed the rock, and its
whiskers twitched in anticipation of the feast in prospect.</p>

<p>The boy saw the beast creep nearer and nearer, then
move more rapidly and poise itself for a spring.</p>

<p>And then there was a sharp, whiplike report, and the
animal leaped straight up into the air, to fall back
writhing in death agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you pull your gun, as you started to do?&#8221;
asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remembered that you didn&#8217;t want us to make a
noise,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill extended his hand and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brave lad, and I admire your courage and
nerve, but I want you to remember that all rules must
give way before a menace to human life&mdash;either your
own or that of another. Use your best judgment, always.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the scout and boy had passed
to the western slope of the range of hills and saw before
them a valley, green and luxuriant, perhaps ten or
twelve miles broad, and banked on the west by another
range of mountains that looked high and forbidding.</p>

<p>They stood out upon the high, bare rock and admired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the beautiful land before them, as yet almost unknown to
civilization. Only the trapper and miner and a few
venturesome herdsmen had sought this wild country.</p>

<p>About a mile out upon the plain was a small herd of
cattle, and a solitary horseman watching them. Perhaps
half a mile up the valley could be seen a rude
hut, and about the door a woman and several small children.</p>

<p>Even as they looked, a party of horsemen appeared on
the plain to the southward, coming out from a gash in the
foothills. It took Buffalo Bill less than half a minute to
decide that they were Indians and that they had seen the
herd of the lone rancher and were bent on mischief.</p>

<p>The scout wondered if the herdsman would see them
in time to take measures for the defense of himself and
his family. The herd was probably as good as lost.</p>

<p>There were about ten of the red riders, and they rode
straight for the cattle, boldly and without attempt to
conceal their presence. They were scarcely three miles
away.</p>

<p>Yes, the herder saw his prospective visitors and began
hustling his stock toward the cabin, which sat at
the base of a little round-topped hill where the creek
made a sharp turn around it.</p>

<p>At first the scout was puzzled. He could not imagine
what safety there would be to the herd in closer proximity
to the building unless the settler hoped to shoot
from behind his cabin walls and keep the reds away from
the herd. But presently he made out a narrow passage
between the hut and the creek which seemed to be an
entrance to a natural amphitheatre on the river side of
the hill.</p>

<p>It was an anxious time for the watching scout, for the
Indians were gaining rapidly and the cattle would run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
here and there and pause to grasp a mouthful or two
of grass.</p>

<p>Then, when they were nearer, the brave wife, in spite
of the oncoming terror, whose yells could now be heard,
ran out and assisted in rounding the stock into the little
inclosure.</p>

<p>Before it was done the Indians were firing rapidly
and bullets must have sprinkled closely about the plucky
herdsman and his helpmeet.</p>

<p>The settler slipped from the saddle, sending his mount
in with the stock, and while the woman darted into the
cabin, he dropped upon one knee and took deliberate
aim at the oncoming, yelling, shooting horsemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crack!&#8221; went the rifle, and one savage pitched from
the saddle. The settler did not move and the riders
came on, broken up somewhat by the dodging, riderless
horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crack!&#8221; a horse and rider plunged into the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crack!&#8221; another riderless horse, and then the red
men wheeled and galloped the other way, to get beyond
the range of that unwavering repeater.</p>

<p>But a fourth was lifted from the saddle before they
were beyond range.</p>

<p>There the Indians paused to hold council. It had
been a costly exploit for them. One brave was undoubtedly
dead and so was a pony. Two red men who had
been wounded were crawling away in the grass, and
the one who rode the dead pony was evidently seriously
hurt, for he lay quite still.</p>

<p>The settler stalked calmly back and forth in front
of his little castle, and the wife now made her appearance
in the doorway with children clinging to her. She
passed her husband another rifle, and took the one he
had to replenish the magazine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Buffalo Bill admired the fortitude of these hardy
frontier folk, but he told the boy that in the darkness
when the settler could not see to make shots count, the
Indians would charge on the little cabin, murder all the
inmates, and drive off the stock. That was all the red
men were waiting for now, the cover of darkness.</p>

<p>That the settler and his wife realized it was seen by
the actions of the woman, who began carrying water
into the cabin from the river and apparently storing it
in barrels and tubs. She also labored unceasingly with
heavy blocks of wood, which probably were to be used
as a barricade. And lastly, she carried pailful after
pailful of water to the thatched roof and soaked it down
thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Indians watched the labors of the &#8220;white squaw,&#8221;
and now and then sent forth derisive yells, but they kept
well beyond reach of the rifle in the hands of the man
who so calmly faced them. They knew, also, that the
settler was well armed, for the woman now brought out
several rifles and leaned them against the cabin in silent
proclamation of their readiness for battle.</p>

<p>As the shadows lengthened in the little valley the
woman once more gave the roof of the shanty a generous
wetting down, removed everything movable to the
interior, and the settler retired to the doorstep with a
barricade of logs in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he will not attempt to remain there after
dark,&#8221; said the scout to his boy companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the Indians can approach to within a few
rods before he can see them and then one mad charge
and all is over, before he can shoot twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to go inside and barricade the door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
shoot from where they can&#8217;t get at him, hadn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
asked the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we help them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly try, as soon as it is dark enough so
they cannot see our approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! I hoped we could, for I am afraid morning
would find the cabin burned and the settlers all murdered.&#8221;</p>

<p>When it was quite dark the two &#8220;Bills&#8221; moved quietly
nearer the little cabin by the mound, expecting every
moment to hear the thunder of pounding hoofs and the
yells of the savages as they bore down to overwhelm
the little stronghold.</p>

<p>The scout obtained a position to suit his taste and then
lay upon the ground to await the opening of hostilities.
At the proper moment he and the boy would surprise the
redskins by taking part in the circus.</p>

<p>Suddenly the expected signal yell came and the
charge was on. Nearer and nearer the ponies thundered
and then out from the stone chimney of the cabin
shot a rocket that lighted up the scenery for rods around.</p>

<p>The Indians struggled with their ponies in amazement,
but before they could pull up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Crack! bang!&#8221; came two shots almost as one, and
two saddles were empty. The settler and his wife had
both scored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em a parting shot, boy, to let &#8217;em know the
settler has friends,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill, as he sent a pony
tumbling by the light of another rocket that soared upward
from the chimney. The boy also dumped a horse
and rider.</p>

<p>This must have surprised the settlers almost, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
fully as much, as it did the Indians, but a surprise was
also coming for the scout and the boy themselves.</p>

<p>As the Indians fled in dismay little spurts of flame
appeared in the grass as they darted by, and &#8220;bang!
bang! bang! poppity bang!&#8221; rang shot after shot.</p>

<p>And then above the other tumult arose the voice of
old Nomad:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar! ye tarnation helgomonian heifercats! take thet
atween yer teeth an&#8217; take ther kinks out ov et! What
yer kihootin&#8217; round hyar for, anyways, disturbin&#8217; honest
critters, an&#8217; keepin&#8217; ther babies erwak?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout laughed. It was apparent that front some
commanding position in the mountains old Nomad and
Cayuse had seen the danger of the settler and his family,
and had hastened thither.</p>

<small>THE SCOUT VISITS SITTING BULL.</small></h2></div>


<p>The Indian band&mdash;what was left of it&mdash;was gone, not
to return. The braves had good cause to believe that
the settler had a small army of men hidden behind every
hillock and every clump of sage brush.</p>

<p>The settler came out to thank the scout and his pards
and to express his wonder at their presence. It seemed
to him almost as if they had dropped from the sky to
his assistance. He said it was the largest band of Indians
he had ever seen in the valley and he had lived
there six years, and had twice before been attacked by
red marauders.</p>

<p>That he was watchful and prepared for them, the scout
had seen, but he cautioned the settler to be doubly careful
in future, for the Sioux were on the warpath and
were centring in the Big Horn country. This valley
was out of the natural course, but some tribes might
send delegations this way.</p>

<p>The settler had made a trip to Fort Phil Kearney the
previous year and was well supplied with the latest in
arms and ammunition. He was prospering, he said; his
herd was increasing, and he easily provided vegetables
for his family by cultivating along the bank of the
creek. Buffalo and antelope were plentiful and fish and
fowl an everyday dish. He would not be driven out;
he had come here to live and rear his family, and only
death would drive him out. He and his wife and children
loved the wild, free life.</p>

<p>Of such were the builders of the West&mdash;hardy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
brave, and determined. They blocked out the frame
of the vast and rich country that can feed nations.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill made himself known and introduced his
pards and the boy. He also told the settler of the miners
in the mountains to the east&mdash;his neighbors. An invitation
was sent to them to call at the settler&#8217;s cabin and
partake of an old-fashioned Eastern dinner.</p>

<p>The scout assured the settler and his wife that he
would gladly bear the message and could promise an
early visit from the miners, who appeared like honest
and respectable men.</p>

<p>Letters were hastily prepared to send to friends in the
East, and then the pards were persuaded to remain at
the cabin till daylight, when they could make much easier
progress across the mountains.</p>

<p>At the first streak of day a bounteous repast was
spread by the settler&#8217;s wife, and all did honor to it.</p>

<p>Good-bys were said, and the pards left the settler
guarding his herd with rifle across his knees, and keen
eyes constantly scanning the plain.</p>

<p>The scout determined to return directly to the mountain
retreat of the miners and hear the reports of the
other parties before continuing the hunt.</p>

<p>He was anxious to capture Price and Ike, and he was
just as desirous of getting in touch with White-man-runs-him,
who had promised to guide him to the headquarters
of Sitting Bull himself, somewhere along the
Big Horn Ca√±on.</p>

<p>The scout had little fear of the red trailer disappointing
him, for he knew Indian traits so well. He also
knew that it would be useless to hunt for White-man-runs-him,
and felt quite confident the trailer would
show up by the allotted day on the next moon, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
wondered where the Indian could be spending the time,
meanwhile.</p>

<p>Several days passed and the search for Price and Ike
was still unrewarded. The scout and his pards had
scoured the mountains for miles in every direction unavailingly.
If the outlaws were there they had a safe
hiding place and food supply.</p>

<p>But the search had brought its reward in one way, for
the miners had discovered gold and a lead that promised
fortune. They were happy, in consequence, and already
were talking of the joys of returning East with money
to pay off mortgages, buy homes, educate children, etc.</p>

<p>It was such as these who blazed the trail&mdash;men driven
to face with grim determination the hardships of such
a life, by the necessities of loved ones&mdash;wives or aged
parents, who needed homes; children who deserved opportunities
in the future.</p>

<p>One morning very early an Indian stalked into camp,
much to the surprise and alarm of the miners, at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he said, and sat by the fire without another
word.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had not arisen from his blanket, but came
out, extended his hand, said &#8220;how,&#8221; and sat beside the
Indian.</p>

<p>Neither spoke until breakfast had been prepared and
eaten and the pipes had been lighted, then the Indian
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Pa-e-has-ka ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is, White-man-runs-him,&#8221; the scout answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good,&#8221; said the Indian, pulling steadily at his
pipe.</p>

<p>At last the Indian arose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&#8220;Two suns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With ponies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go with ponies,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse saddled Bear Paw and brought out the pony
that had followed from the plain, for the Indian.</p>

<p>White-man-runs-him examined the pony carefully
and expressed himself with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap good pony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the scout; &#8220;he is a very good pony;
he is yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted the Indian, once more going over the
handsome little animal, and then swinging upon his back
with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill&#8217;s pards were left in the hills and continued
to prosecute the search for Price and Ike, while
the scout rode off to visit Sitting Bull, near Big Horn
Ca√±on.</p>

<p>That Buffalo Bill&#8217;s interview with the powerful chief
of the Dakota nation was fruitless is a matter of history.
The Napoleon of the Sioux would hear to no terms. He
was defiant. He said his people had been robbed, and
now the Great Father at Washington had demanded the
land on which they lived. The white man with the
pick and shovel, and with traps and gun were killing off
and driving the game and fur from the red man&#8217;s hunting
grounds. They would move no more. If the red
man was to be driven from the face of the earth it must
be done with bullet and steel.</p>

<p>The Indian chief would listen to no argument or appeal.
Crazy Horse, who had combined forces with Sitting
Bull, held the same views and determination. Both
recognized and proclaimed the friendship of Pa-e-has-ka,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Long Hair, to their followers, but they were obdurate.
Pa-e-has-ka&#8217;s tongue was straight, and he did not
know of all the crooked tongues of his people. If the
Sioux were to be moved let the white soldiers come and
move them.</p>

<p>Such were the replies to the scout&#8217;s entreaties for the
red man and the white brothers. He would have averted
war, but they would fight, and such must be the report
of Buffalo Bill to the Great Father at Washington.</p>

<p>The scout shook hands with Sitting Bull sadly, and
the immobile countenance of the chief expressed less of
his emotions than did the warm pressure of Pa-e-has-ka&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>The return to the heavy hills along what is now known
as Pryor Creek, or rather to the range lying between that
river and Beauvais Creek, was without incident, and
nothing but the most friendly feeling was expressed by
the Indians met. These parties frequently asked for information
concerning the whereabouts of the headquarters
of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Spotted Tail, Red
Cloud, and others. They were little bands of braves contributed
by tribes far and near going to the aid of the
uprising organized by Sitting Bull.</p>

<p>The bloody war which followed in the next few
months is well within the memory of the present generation,
and it behooves all well-regulated boyish minds
to familiarize themselves with that important part of our
nation&#8217;s history, but which it is not my province to relate.</p>

<small>HIDE-RACK&#8217;S ADVENTURES.</small></h2></div>


<p>As the sun sank behind the gray haze of the mountain
peaks that backed the purple of the foothills of the
Great Continental Divide, two men stole down to a
roily creek and sought something floatable on which to
cross.</p>

<p>This pair, pitiable in haggard faces and half-clad
forms, and staggering with the weakness which long
journeyings and hunger had wrought, furtively studied
the narrow radius of the crooked gash the creek made
in the plain. That they feared pursuit any observer
would have said; that hope was low and endurance on
its last legs was evident.</p>

<p>Crouching there, their hollow eyes eagerly seeking
means of placing this slight barrier between them and
their expected pursuers, they saw a lone Indian paddling
his canoe up the creek.</p>

<p>They crouched among the willows and waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I knock him over?&#8221; asked one, fingering his
rifle trigger suggestively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet; let&#8217;s try to hire him to put us over, or, better
still, take us far down the stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! and perhaps he can procure food for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian was hailed and came ashore for parley.
He was a trapper, a probable outcast from some tribe,
and was ready for barter. Yes, he would take them
down the creek. &#8220;Food heap plenty&mdash;much fish and
prairie dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian didn&#8217;t want money&mdash;he had been swindled&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
he wanted rifle &#8220;heap bad.&#8221; So they struck a bargain.
He was to paddle them down as far as the Big
Horn and there deliver to them the canoe for one of
their rifles.</p>

<p>The Indian had plenty of pemmican and was willing
to trade for powder and ball. The trade was eagerly
made, and the half-starved men fell to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even biltong tastes good if a man is hungry enough,&#8221;
said one, as they rode down the sluggish current.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does, Ike, but I&#8217;m tired of this dodging and
starving existence. I think I&#8217;ll give in and take my
medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A blamed fool you are, if you do, Price. We have
just got over the bunch. We have something to eat
and a canoe. In the canoe we can paddle up the Big
Horn nights and hide along the shore days, until we
are out of the territory, where we are known. Then, if
we can&#8217;t put up some sort of a yarn that will give us
a start we are not as sharp as our friends have always
counted us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian shot a glance of intelligence at the pair,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>Where the creek poured into the Big Horn a sharp
turn to the right was made after the Indian had been
landed, and Price and Ike began the tedious journey up
the wildly picturesque river, knowing little of what it
promised other than that it found its source hundreds of
miles to the southwest, flowed northeasterly, and by following
southward they would have a blazed trail toward
settlements where their names had never been heard.</p>

<p>If this precious pair had known much that they later
found out they would as soon have paddled their canoe
over Niagara Falls as up the Big Horn River.</p>

<p>That night they paddled until well toward morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
when, worn and weary, they sought the bank and found
shelter for the day.</p>

<p>An hour later red hands parted the willows and a
pair of black eyes peered through at the sleeping men.</p>

<p>The bushes sprung back into place noiselessly and a
satisfied &#8220;Ugh!&#8221; escaped the red man&#8217;s lips as he hurried
away.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon two large canoes came up the
river and four men pulled them up beside the one which
had been carefully hidden there in the morning. The
occupants of the last canoes were Buffalo Bill, White-man-runs-him,
Hickok, and Skibo.</p>

<p>The Indian took the lead and a moment later the
fugitives were aroused to find themselves once more
prisoners. They were disarmed, securely bound, and
loaded, one in each canoe, and the long run down the
Big Horn begun.</p>

<p>The remainder of Buffalo Bill&#8217;s party, with all the
horses, had headed back to the Yellowstone, where the
scout hoped to join them in the next few days. His
plans were to run down the Big Horn to the junction of
the Yellowstone, where he had information that a detachment
of U. S. Cavalry, on a scouting expedition,
were encamped. If he was lucky enough to find them
there he would turn over his prisoners to them and then
pull up the Yellowstone to join his pards. He hoped, too,
to receive orders in possession of the cavalry officers
from headquarters, and to forward his report of Sitting
Bull&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>Fortune favored and he arrived the night before the
cavalry orders were to return to the spot near the
present Miles City, where Fort Keogh was established.</p>

<p>As he had expected, he received orders that sent him
once more into the far country, and his mission, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of a far different nature, led to a series of adventures
rivaling any in his experience.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the detachment was glad to
receive the prisoner Price, who had once slipped through
the army&#8217;s fingers, and that Bloody Ike would receive
just deserts, after a civil trial, there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>But this particular detachment could not well foresee
rapidly approaching events, which not only robbed it
of its prisoners, but several of its officers and men of
their freedom.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill&#8217;s present order, to offer Sitting Bull and
his chiefs one more chance, had been obeyed, and his
report was on its way to Washington.</p>

<p>Before the scout took up his next work, he determined
to return to Bozeman, and on the way to pay a visit
to the Averys and Coreys, and see that the boy, &#8220;Little
Buffalo Bill,&#8221; was safe with his parents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Old Nomad, Cayuse, Avery, and young Corey expected
to make the trip to Avery&#8217;s ranch in three days,
but in a set-to with a small band of Indians, the trapper
was knocked from the saddle by a bullet and Hide-rack
galloped away with three Indians in pursuit.</p>

<p>The trapper was not seriously injured, the bullet just
grazing along the scalp, but he felt deeply the loss of
his famous horse. Nomad determined to recover the
horse, if possible. He ordered the party into camp immediately,
in a rock-bound gully, which could be easily
defended, and then, on Bear Paw, set out alone to recover
his horse.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the trapper parted
from his comrades, and he promised to be back before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
daylight the following morning, whether he recovered
Hide-rack or not.</p>

<p>The trail of the Indians was easy to follow until dark,
and soon after the trapper saw a camp fire and guessed
that the Indians had camped. He approached cautiously
and saw that the reds had built their camp fire in the
mouth of a little blind ca√±on, into which they had succeeded
in heading Hide-rack.</p>

<p>Apparently the horse had given them so much trouble
to capture him that they had turned their ponies in to
make his acquaintance and perhaps soothe his ruffled
temper.</p>

<p>But Hide-rack had evidently decided to form no new
acquaintance. As Nomad reached a position from which
he could command a view of the pocket, his &#8220;horse pard&#8221;
was just in the act of making an impression on the
ponies. The impression they got was of a vicious pair
of heels that seemed shooting out in all directions at
once.</p>

<p>The Indians, fearing for the legs if not the lives of
their ponies, rushed in to take a hand.</p>

<p>Then old Nomad broke loose with a wild:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yip-yip-yar-r-r! Hide-rack, give it to &#8217;em, ole hoss!
Don&#8217;t let no dirty redskin put a hand onto ye! Soak
&#8217;em, ole pard!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Hide-rack, in response to his master&#8217;s voice,
did &#8220;soak &#8217;em.&#8221; He rushed at the Indians like a mad
thing, biting, striking, and kicking.</p>

<p>Before they could get out of the way the horse laid out
two of the red men and was pursuing the third, who ran
like a deer straight through the camp fire, with the
vengeful Hide-rack only one jump behind.</p>

<p>The savage dodged among the rocks and escaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
while Hide-rack capered up to Bear Paw with a whinny
of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye kicked ther tarnal stuffin&#8217; outen um, didn&#8217;t ye, ole
pard?&#8221; yelled Nomad in high glee, as he cantered back
across the plain.</p>

<p>It was the fourth day when Nomad&#8217;s party reached
Avery&#8217;s ranch and found all well, and no Indians had
been seen for several days.</p>

<p>Two days later Buffalo Bill, Hickok, and Skibo arrived,
to rest a bit before continuing their labors.</p>

the Piute boy, who had come up and was listening
to the usual verbal firing between Buffalo Bill&#8217;s pards.</p>

<p>Wild Bill, who had also sauntered along, remained
quiet, puffing away at his pipe, but now he hailed the
scout, who was coming from the bungalow, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the word, Cody&mdash;does the boy go?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout nodded with a smile and said to the lad:</p>

<p>&#8220;Run in and cheer them up, boy, and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Buffalo Bill had secured the scout&#8217;s permission&mdash;if
his parents were willing&mdash;to accompany him on his
new mission.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill did not urge them to let the boy go,
but he assured them he would do his best for the lad&#8217;s
comfort and safety, if they permitted him to accompany
the pards.</p>

<p>And at last they had consented, with tears and heartaches,
to grant the boy&#8217;s pleadings.</p>

<p>The horses were saddled and Mr. Avery led out his
best, a gritty, bay mare that could run &#8220;like a prairie
fire,&#8221; he said, for the boy.</p>

<p>All was in readiness when the lad bolted out of the
door, bounded into the saddle, and dashed away without
turning to right or left.</p>

<p>The scout and his pards waved adieu and rode off
leisurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the boy alone,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill, &#8220;and when
he feels himself he will fall back with the rest of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s orders had read:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;Report at Fort Phil Kearney after seeing Sitting
Bull.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all, and the scout wondered why the dispatch
had been so brief and devoid of detail. He had
read and reread the order, and pondered over it. There
was only one logical conclusion, and that was that some
matter concerning the army was to be investigated and
the officials in Washington did not fully trust some
of the hands through which this order must pass to
reach him.</p>

<p>It was probably one hundred and fifty miles to Fort
Kearney, and the scout hoped General Sheridan himself
would be there. Although his order did not refer to it,
Buffalo Bill expected to find full instructions at the fort.
The scout was more or less curious to know, and the
Laramie man speculated much, but old Nomad could
hardly wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye know, Buffler, I didn&#8217;t like ther look o&#8217; that
chap thet brung ther paper talk. I don&#8217;t blame Uncle
Sammy for not trustin&#8217; him &#8217;th any news wuth mentionin&#8217;;
I wouldn&#8217;t trust &#8217;im &#8217;s fur as I c&#8217;d throw Hide-rack
by ther tail, which same &#8217;s a middlin&#8217; short distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah specs Nomad&#8217;s been usin&#8217; &#8217;is dreamer some mo&#8217;,&#8221;
observed Skibo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looky hyar, Skibo, this &#8217;ere haint none o&#8217; yore funeral,
so yer better stay out. What yer gittin&#8217; at, anyways?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuffin much, Nomad, on&#8217;y yo&#8217; wa&#8217;n&#8217;t present, nohow,
w&#8217;en de ossifer fotch de cumflaboration f&#8217;m yo&#8217;
Uncle Samwell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad looked foolish for a moment and then he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the picked-tailed honey bees I warn&#8217;t, wor I?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Must er been thet measly red hoss thief thet gut erway
&#8217;th Hide-rack I&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbeso Nomad thinkum &#8217;bout &#8216;ketchumnappin&#8217;,&#8217;&#8221;
suggested Cayuse.</p>

<p>The scout laughed and Hickok and Skibo asked for
information. They hadn&#8217;t heard the joke. Nomad galloped
on ahead and the scout told of the trapper&#8217;s attempt
to fool Price and Bloody Ike in the ca√±on, by
tearing out a shirt sleeve and filling it with sand to
throw in the darkness for them to shoot at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they shoot at it?&#8221; asked Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they threw some sort of a torch that Ike fixed
up, and which lighted up the whole place so that Nomad
had to skedaddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pards laughed so heartily that Nomad looked
around and shook his fist at them, and then put spurs
to Hide-rack and came up with the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we call the boy for short?&#8221; asked the
scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Make-um-noise&#8217; plenty short for him,&#8221; said Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Billie,&#8217;&#8221; said Skibo, &#8220;then we hab Buffalo Bill, Wild
Bill, an&#8217; Billie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are getting too many Bills and not enough receipts,&#8221;
said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not call him &#8216;Tootsie,&#8217; in honor of his profession?&#8221;
asked the Laramie man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; was the chorus, and &#8220;Tootsie, the boy bugler,&#8221;
stuck to the boy from that day.</p>

<p>At noon the party halted the horses to graze an hour,
and all the others found that &#8220;Tootsie&#8221; had regained
his usual demeanor and was the life of the party. His
new name amused him, but he accepted it with good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
grace, and sang, after pulling his bugle from his saddle
horn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">When Indians get funny just give &#8217;em a toot</div>
<div class="indent">And send &#8217;em a-whoopin&#8217; an&#8217; crazy;</div>
<div class="verse">But when you want noises, why call the galoot</div>
<div class="indent">Called &#8220;Corey,&#8221; and &#8220;Billie,&#8221; and &#8220;Tootsie.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Tootsie waved his bugle, danced a jig, and wound up
with a toot-toot-ta-tar-rum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s ther stuff, Tootsie, wake us up, er I may git
ter dreamin&#8217; ergin.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they camped at the mouth of a little ravine
which offered water and tender grass for the
horses.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night, and the scout, when the moon
arose, was tempted to &#8220;stretch his legs a bit,&#8221; after
a long day in the saddle, and look about the country.</p>

<p>Tootsie asked permission to accompany him and the
request was promptly granted.</p>

<p>They set out, keeping a southerly course along the
bank of the ravine until they came out on a flat-topped
and vertical-sided butte of considerable height.</p>

<p>In the hazy light they could not see far, but the soft
evening breezes from the almost limitless plains came
sweet and pure and dream-inducing.</p>

<p>Standing well out on the cliff, the scout noticed that
under the side of a neighboring butte of like formation,
one hundred rods away, a party of Indians were
holding some sort of a ceremony. He had no doubt
they were warriors and offering some sacrifice to propitiate
the Great Spirit because of their intended exploit,
or to win protection in expected battles to come.</p>

<p>The scout told Tootsie of his surmise, and the boy
was filled with a desire to get near enough to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and see the ceremonies. So they made their way
through a difficult gulch and scaled the butte beyond
which the chanting of the red men now could be heard.</p>

<p>There were twoscore of the braves, and a part of the
services consisted of prancing in file around a pot of
water which was sending up a great volume of steam
from where it hung over a bright fire.</p>

<p>Occasionally a rock was pulled from the fire with
sticks and dropped into the pot to increase the volume
of steam; then the Indians would caper around the pot,
chanting loudly, waving their arms, and now and then
darting up to brush hands and arms through the ascending
steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see what they would do, if I blowed a good
blast on my bugle,&#8221; said Tootsie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might wish you hadn&#8217;t tried it, before it was
over,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we keep out of sight and mystify them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would probably go back up the gully where
they could climb the cliff and come up to investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose they would do if a tall white
figure stood out here in the moonlight and waved its
arms and I blowed the bugle at the same time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would shoot at the tall white figure,&#8221; laughed
the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose the ghost kept right on waving its arms and
blowing the bugle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think you&#8217;d have them stampeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your &#8216;tall white figure?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy pulled from under his blouse a roll of white.
The goods was plain cotton, and inside was a jointed
arrangement of hollow reeds with strings running
through them. These he adjusted skillfully and lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the figure erect. By pulling strings at the bottom the
arms waved weirdly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The scout was amused and decided not to interfere
with the boy&#8217;s plans.</p>

<p>Tootsie found a desirable position where he could approach
the very edge of the cliff, and, lying flat, peep
down at the Indians, and at the same time operate his
dummy and blow the bugle.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill found a similar position almost directly
over the heads of the Indians.</p>

<p>Tootsie stood his figure on the edge of the cliff as
though it were dancing on air, and then gave a triumphant
bugle call.</p>

<p>The Indians below scattered instantly, seizing arms of
all sort before they looked for the cause.</p>

<p>Another &#8220;tar-ta-ta-tar&mdash;ta-ta-tar!&#8221; and they looked
up and saw the strange human form swaying in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Slowly the arms began to rise, and when they were
wide extended there came a loud, strong blast, sinking
away into a faint imitation that sounded like an echo.</p>

<p>The Indians were irresolute. They hardly knew
whether to attribute the strange scene to supernatural
demonstration or trickery. They held brief council and
then one stepped back, and taking deliberate aim, fired.</p>

<p>He was answered by a defiant blast and wild waving
of the arms, as the figure danced along the edge
of the rock for a few feet and back.</p>

<p>The Indians moved away in awe at the spectacle.
But they mustered courage enough to fire again, and
once more came the strong blast of the bugle and the
dancing and waving of arms.</p>

<p>Then came a volley from a score of rifles, and some
of the bullets found the framework of Tootsie&#8217;s image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and the thing crumpled pitifully upon the rock above
his head.</p>

<p>But Tootsie was equal to the occasion, for he sent
forth a weird, plaintive wail that died away in a moan
and then kept up a series of nerve-rasping cries and
wails.</p>

<p>At the same time Buffalo Bill dropped a rock over
the brink, which, descending with great good luck,
landed fairly in the kettle of water, sending hot water
and steam in all directions, breaking the kettle and extinguishing
the fire, with much hissing and popping,
all in one operation.</p>

<p>The Indians could not see the rock descending, but
they saw the dying figure on the brink of the precipice
and the demolition of their offering, as if by magic.</p>

<p>Then they fled, vaulting upon their ponies and urging
the animals away across the plain with quirt and
heel.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill could speak, from laughing, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The sound of a bugle will give those fellows nervous
prostration for a long time to come. And the mysterious
&#8216;bad medicine&#8217; will be handed from party to party
and tribe to tribe for generations, and whenever an
Indian passes these buttes he will offer some present to
propitiate the spirits.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<small>REVENGE OF PRICE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Before the final downfall of Price he had been deeply
interested in the beautiful sister of the wife of Doctor
Karl Griffin, of Bozeman. Although he received no encouragement
from the young lady, Miss Dorothy Reed&mdash;called
Dot&mdash;he took it upon himself to feel encouraged,
and had been a frequent visitor at the doctor&#8217;s
residence.</p>

<p>Doctor Griffin had no love for the Indian agent, but as
the latter had large influence and was constant in his
manifestations of good will, he felt obliged to tolerate
the agent&#8217;s presence in his household.</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s wife and Miss Reed also were politely
tolerant only. They had heard much of the character
of Price, and concerning their approval or disapproval
it is only necessary to say that both were highly respectable
and intelligent young ladies. Both were graduates
of an Eastern college and reared in a good old
Virginia home.</p>

<p>The doctor, after receiving his diploma from McGill
University and serving a year in a New York hospital,
married Miss Clarice Reed and went West for health
and fortune, and to devote himself to his profession.</p>

<p>Miss Dottie Reed, after graduation, had come to pay
her sister an extended visit. She loved the big West
with its possibilities. It made the East seem narrow,
and pinched, and crowded. She loved the purple haze
of mountains and the greenish brown of the plains. From
Castle Rock to the gorges of the Bridger Range she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
loved the wild, free life with its crudeness and roughness
of the unhewn block of civilization.</p>

<p>And Price, coarse as he was, dishonest as he was, and
generally bad as he was, first admired, then respected,
and finally entertained a warmer emotion for the gay
little college girl.</p>

<p>Such were conditions in that part of Bozeman that
centred around young Doctor Griffin and his family, when
Lieutenant Avery, just out from West Point, arrived on
the scene.</p>

<p>Long horseback rides in the beautiful Gallatin Valley
with Miss Dot Reed won for the dashing lieutenant the
cordial hatred of Price and culminated in an open insult
in public, for which the young lieutenant disarmed
and then soundly thrashed Price, the first time he saw
the Indian agent alone.</p>

<p>Price&#8217;s threats were blood-curdling in their intense
hatred, and twice after that attacks were made on Lieutenant
Avery at night after he had left the residence of
Doctor Griffin.</p>

<p>Miss Dot became Mrs. Avery in the autumn preceding
the exciting events which ended the career of Price as an
Indian agent and his arrest by Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>But before his arrest and imprisonment Price had
perfected a scheme for revenge on Lieutenant Avery
through his acquaintance and influence with certain officers,
one of whom was jealous of young Avery&#8217;s advancement
over him in the army.</p>

<p>After his marriage Lieutenant Avery was sent to Fort
Phil Kearney, and while Buffalo Bill was in the Bad
Lands, Lieutenant Avery and his young bride had disappeared
from Fort Phil Kearney.</p>

<p>It was a puzzle for the military men, and it was even
whispered about that Lieutenant Avery was in trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in the East and had fled with his wife to take up their
abode beyond the reach of the law.</p>

<p>These whispered rumors were at first sternly discountenanced,
but were insistently repeated from some unknown
source, and then it was said that Lieutenant
Avery had married a girl in the East while in college,
and that this wife number one had heard of his
marriage to Miss Reed and was on the way West to
confront him with his perfidy.</p>

<p>Young Avery had firm friends in the army, and they
refused to accept a word of these stories. They believed
the young lieutenant and his wife had been captured
or murdered by a roving party of red men, and
they continued active search.</p>

<p>An order was sent to Buffalo Bill to report at old Fort
Phil Kearney for further orders. General Sheridan, because
of some things that had been brought to his notice,
distrusting a certain officer through whose hands this order
must pass to Buffalo Bill, gave no detail of the
scout&#8217;s commission. He knew that Cody would report at
Fort Kearney at the earliest possible moment, and in the
meantime the general would prepare and forward his
orders to that place.</p>

<p>As subsequent events proved, it would have been
better had he ordered Buffalo Bill to investigate that
portion of the military organization in the Northwest.</p>

<p>Through what connivance Price was the second time
enabled to escape, probably never will be known. At
that time it was as much a mystery as was the disappearance
of Lieutenant Avery and his bride, and there
was a strong inclination in the army toward the belief
that both were engineered by the same hand.</p>

<p>Nothing could be proved, however, and it remained
a mystery for some time.</p>

<small>WONDERFUL MIRROR OF THE PLAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Buffler, what d&#8217;ye make out o&#8217; thet mirrij?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Nomad had aroused the scout very early to look
at the sky, which reflected the plain for miles.</p>

<p>The pards had camped the previous evening in a basin
in the broken clay of the Bad Lands where the rains
had formed a miniature lake, around which grass had
started up luxuriantly. The place resembled an immense
&#8220;buffalo wallow&#8221; and had all the appurtenances in
the way of &#8220;buffalo flies&#8221; which at first threatened to
drive the thin-haired horses into a stampede, when the
party first arrived late in the afternoon. But a flock of
starlings came soon after and, alighting on the horses,
soon put the flies to rout.</p>

<p>Cayuse had stumbled upon the place in the afternoon
and it was decided to remain where there was good grazing
and plenty of water, although the latter was not an
attractive quality.</p>

<p>Hidden from the surrounding country, with the
breeze sweeping across the pool, after the sun went
down the pards found it to be a delightful camping
ground.</p>

<p>They slept soundly, and although two-hour watches
placed each, with the exception of Tootsie, on guard
during the night, not the slightest cause for alarm was
discovered.</p>

<p>It was old Nomad&#8217;s morning watch and he had finally
awakened Buffalo Bill to study a beautifully clear mirage,
which depicted a scene that puzzled the trapper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>The young reader may not know that the phenomenon
referred to is extremely common in some localities, and
due to atmospheric conditions. It is usually caused
by a diminution of the density of the air near the surface
of the earth, often produced by the radiation of heat,
the denser stratum being thus above instead of below the
rarer, which latter is the usual case. Now, rays of light
from a distant object, situated in the denser medium&mdash;that
is, a little above the earth&#8217;s level&mdash;coming in a direction
nearly parallel to the earth&#8217;s surface, meet the rarer
medium at a very obtuse angle, and instead of passing
into it, they are reflected back to the dense medium,
thus acting as a mirror.</p>

<p>The image produced by the reflected rays will appear
inverted, and below the real object, just as an image
reflected in the water appears when observed from a
distance. The phenomena are frequently much more
strange and complicated, the images being often much
distorted and magnified, and in some instances occurring
at a considerable distance from the object, as in
case of a church seen over the sea or an inverted vessel
sailing over the land. If the object is a cloud, or portion
of sky, it will appear by the reflected rays as lying on
the surface of the earth and bearing a strong resemblance
to a sheet of water; also, as the reflecting
surface is irregular, and constantly varies in position,
owing to the constant communication of heat to the
upper stratum, the reflected image will be constantly
varying, and will present the appearance of a water
surface ruffled by the wind.</p>

<p>Thus in the deserts of lower Egypt, Persia, Turkestan,
and on the great Western plains of the United States,
whole caravans have been led from the trail by thirst
toward an inviting lake which appears to be but a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
miles away. If the ground is favorable the mirage
may be dispelled as the observer advances, but in others
it is like an ignis fatuus, hovering ever in sight, but
always beyond reach, until the victim succumbs to thirst
and his body is left a monument to his own misunderstanding
of one of nature&#8217;s most fascinating jokes.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill came to the trapper&#8217;s side on the rim
of the basin, where Nomad pointed to the southwest.
The sky looked a lead-colored haze that held well down
to the horizon, with a belt of clear blue underneath,
but nearer, and seeming a few miles away, was a tracery
in the heavens, apparently far below the clouds, of a vast
map of the plain.</p>

<p>The buttes, and ravines, and gashes, the buffalo wallows,
skulls, and clusters of weeds, were laid out across
the sky with a variation of distinctness and color.</p>

<p>The distortions were surprising, the images coming
suddenly nearer or fading away in the distance. A
little brook suddenly grew to a great river and objects
seemed to be moving on its surface.</p>

<p>But more surprising than all the rest was the mirrored
outline of a crack in the hard-baked surface of the
plain. Reflected there in the peculiar morning sky, the
crevice looked to be several feet wide and running for
a long distance in a direction that allowed the smaller
or farther end to fade out and disappear in the distance,
while the nearer approached diagonally until it
appeared scarcely half a mile away, ending in the side of
a strangely marked butte.</p>

<p>This latter, seen top down in the sky, appeared hollow,
surrounded by a high, square-topped wall. And the
centre of the hollow reflected green.</p>

<p>Down the crevice toward the butte some object was
moving. Sometimes it came out clearly, enormously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
magnified by the variation of heat radiation, and would
seem about to be distinctly revealed in every detail to
the observer; then its brilliancy would fade.</p>

<p>On the whole, the moving object looked like some
gigantic worm crawling along the rut made by a narrow-rimmed
wheel. The reflection gave no detail below
the ground level, because of a different layer of air
there, but moving along the centre of this outlined
crevice was the bobbing, disappearing, and reappearing
object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that git yer guessworks clogged, Buffler?&#8221;
said Nomad, after a period of silent observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is a puzzler; call the rest of the boys
and see what they think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the mirage had faded the pards had seen the
crawling thing reach the mirrored butte and disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not in the direction we travel,&#8221; said Hickok,
&#8220;but I move we go out of our way a few miles to see if
that picture was painted true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I second ther motion,&#8221; said Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is moved and approved that we make a tour of
investigation to satisfy our own curiosity,&#8221; said Buffalo
Bill. &#8220;If that be your minds you will so vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>All raised their hands and answered &#8220;Ay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Breakfast was prepared and eaten and then the pards
set off on a mission of inquisitiveness which led to one
of the strangest adventures that ever befell either of
the famous scouts.</p>

<p>While the mirrored picture of the gash and butte represented
the scene as not more than half a mile distant,
after a ride of an hour the pards had seen nothing
that looked like it. They had hardly expected to

with the exception of Tootsie, they were familiar with
the false reports of nature&#8217;s news sheet.</p>

<p>Another hour and they had paused on the crest of
one of the great prairie waves to study the surroundings,
when Buffalo Bill, who was using a field glass, uttered
an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>The scout handed the glass to Wild Bill, who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;By gorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad reached for the glass and alter a moment&#8217;s
study of a distant butte, let loose with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, by ther ring-tailed, rip-snortin&#8217; heifercats!
Wouldn&#8217;t thet make ye swaller yer gum?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Skibo&#8217;s turn, and after a moment the giant black
man handed the glass to Tootsie and turned to Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars&#8217; Billyum,&#8221; he said, &#8220;yer goin&#8217; sabe de lil&#8217; missy
if it takes de las&#8217; piece ob meat f&#8217;m ole Skibo&#8217;s bones to
do it&mdash;ain&#8217;t dat so, Mars&#8217; Billyum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sees us and seems to think we are Indians,
for she is running along the top of the mesa and now
she drops out of sight!&#8221; cried the boy excitedly.</p>

<p>The cause of the exclamations by the scout and his
pards was the sight of a girl, or young woman, with
long yellow hair floating in the wind, standing on the
top of a high, perpendicular-sided butte, and, apparently,
studying the landscape by peering under her hand.</p>

<p>The butte on which the girl stood seemed above its
surroundings and alone. Not a wrinkle on the surface
about it showed at that distance, but far beyond could
be seen the sheen of a river, with bushes and little
bunches of timber along its banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe she&#8217;s a angel, but I didn&#8217;t notice any wings,&#8221;
mused Nomad, staring in that direction, although with
the naked eye he failed to see the picture on the bluff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8220;Yah, yah! Ah reckons she mus&#8217; hab wings, ter hab
flewed so high to roost,&#8221; remarked Skibo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably the other side of the butte is scalable,&#8221; observed
Wild Bill, &#8220;but if a maiden is lost or hiding from
Indians, we ought to rescue her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right, Hickok,&#8221; said the scout, &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He hesitated. Buffalo Bill was thinking of the mirage
of the morning. There was the butte of the same contour
as the one mirrored in the sky. The crevice did
not show, but he believed it would be visible, on nearer
approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what, Buffler?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we have discovered all we shall of this mystery
unless we spend a lot of time on it,&#8221; quietly answered
the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I was thinking,&#8221; said Wild Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t think this hyar kentry is <i>muy malo</i>, do ye?&#8221;
queried Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Nomad; I think the country is all right, but
I&#8217;ll wager that there is some deep mystery in this case
of a girl on the apex of a pinnacle in the middle of the
wildest country in the Northwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will investigate as far as practicable at this time,
and, if we do not reach an explanation readily&mdash;as I do
expect we shall&mdash;we must ride on and attend to our
duties first; then if we care to come back here to unravel
a mystery, that will be our privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Righto!&#8221; chirped Wild Bill, &#8220;but suppose we toddle
on the base of the bluff and look around it? That will
not occupy much time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were obliged to advance more or less cautiously
because of the broken nature of the footing, seams and
chasms running hither and thither, like rivulets after a
shower.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>At last at the base of the isolated butte, which was
much larger and higher than it appeared from the distance,
the pards found it to be a precipitous wall of
more than one hundred feet from base to top of the
main cone, and this was surrounded by a massive foot-piece
more than half as high and three times as broad.</p>

<p>By difficult climbing and jumping wide and deep
crevices, they at last attained the top of the base rock,
which was as level as a house floor and formed a
plateau of probably two hundred acres. Out of the
centre of this arose the shaft first seen, towering scores
of feet above them, an apparently solid block of rock,
smaller in circumference at the base than at the top, as
smooth and as impossible of ascent as the outer surface
of Bunker Hill monument.</p>

<p>It was on the top of this block, which was perhaps
sixteen hundred feet in circumference or five hundred
feet in diameter, that they had seen a human being.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Member what I said erbout angels?&#8221; asked Nomad,
staring up dizzily at the top, which seemed wavering
against the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars&#8217; Billyum, Ah reckons &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t do no harm
&#8217;f Ah should jes&#8217; holler a few words o&#8217; United States
so&#8217;s de lil&#8217; missy won&#8217;t t&#8217;ink we&#8217;s Injuns,&#8221; suggested
Skibo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is no need of it, Skibo,&#8221; answered the
scout, who, with head thrown back, had been studying
the top of the rock.</p>

<p>As the scout spoke a hush fell over all the pards,
for there had suddenly appeared on the very edge of the
pinnacle a girlish figure quaintly dressed and looking
down at them.</p>

<p>The scout and Wild Bill doffed their sombreros and
the former shouted:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>&#8220;Can we be of service to you, young lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; I think not. I am as free as the air and
the birds, and care not for the ways of the world or its
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you alone?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you ask? If I am happy and need nothing
of the world, why should it care whether I am alone
or not? The dark-skinned people of the plain respect
my desires and call me, in their tongue, the daughter
of the moon. I go and come as I wish among them.
But the dark-skinned people hate the white-skinned people
and hope to drive them into the sea. Even now I
can see, far across the plain, a large party of mounted
warriors who come this way. If my white-skinned
brothers remain here they will be slain or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go that way&#8221;&mdash;and she pointed to the south and east.
&#8220;Two miles on you will find a river. Follow it far
and keep well to the timber, for on both sides the country
swarms with red brothers who are hostile to the
white brothers. Go! and tell the white people who ask,
that I am the mystery of the lone rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>She disappeared, and the scout and his pards turned
away as she had directed, but not until Buffalo Bill had
discovered the crevice which the mirage had revealed,
leading from far away toward the river to the base of
the butte. He mistrusted that some hidden entrance led
under the bluff to the hollow interior which the inverted
cone had shown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>TRAGEDY OF THE PLAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>Lieutenant Avery had been sent from Fort Leavenworth
to Fort Laramie, thence to Fort Fetterman and on
to Fort Phil Kearney. At each place he and his bride,
both of whom were passionately fond of horseback riding,
had taken long gallops into the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Before he had left the Yellowstone, to Lieutenant
Avery had been confided a secret by a brother officer.
This captain had asked young Avery not to mention the
legend, which was of the country to the northward of
Fort Phil Kearney. He had suggested that Avery, if
he should be sent to that fort, should investigate, in a
quiet way, the foundation of the Indian belief.</p>

<p>The story he told in detail was of fascinating interest
to the lieutenant, who asked permission only to repeat
it to his wife. The captain said it came to him from
an Indian trailer who was familiar with that part of
the Northwest, and said the Indians there told in whispers
of a white queen, of Indian blood, who ruled the
stars. They believed her to be the daughter of the
moon, because of her pale beauty and great mass of
yellow hair, which curled about her face like a halo.</p>

<p>This girl was said by the Indians to be of magnificent
physical proportions and to fear nothing. She was
supposed to be protected by the spirits, and great buffaloes
and grizzly bears lay down and fawned at her
feet. She was said by the red man to live upon a sacred
mountain which none could scale, and to appear on its
top in the moonlight conferring with the spirits. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
was said to have a voice of such marvelous purity and
sweetness that angels hovered near to listen and to applaud
when she sang from the top of the mountain at
evening. The Indians made offerings before the mountain
and carried meat, fish, berries, and skins, which the
rock itself swallowed up.</p>

<p>The captain said the Indian only had told him because
he&mdash;the captain&mdash;had saved the red trailer&#8217;s life,
and the latter had repeated the story as never before
having been told for white men to scoff at. The red
man had enjoined great secrecy, but the captain claimed
that his curiosity had been excited, and he wanted some
reliable white man to discover, if possible, upon what
these Indian fairy tales were based.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Avery had promised to interest himself in
the matter if he was ordered to Fort Phil Kearney. The
country had been so graphically described to him that
the young officer believed he could recognize the sacred
mountain, if he should see it at a distance. It was said
to be twenty miles from the fort in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>It was because of the captain&#8217;s story that the young
lieutenant and his bride galloped northward one morning
early, although warned by the officer in command
to be constantly on the lookout for Indians, for they
were becoming very troublesome in recent months. Although
the couple had ridden out several miles in all
directions during the first few days after their arrival,
they had seen no Indian bands, and only an occasional
lone red man after game or, more likely, headed for
some fort or settlement for fire water or tobacco.</p>

<p>Avery was a daring fellow, and his young wife feared
nothing when he was present. Their comradeship became
proverbial at the military stations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>After the young couple rode away that morning their
fate became a sealed book, and in due time the high
army officials looked to Buffalo Bill to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>The Indians had suddenly appeared in numbers and
constantly harassed the soldiers. Every mail brought
news of atrocities all along the border of the Indian
country. In this section the Cheyennes and Sioux were
the terror of the frontiersman.</p>

<p>Proceeding at an easy canter the young lieutenant
and his wife enjoyed the pure morning air. Here and
there they would sometimes catch a glimpse of young
coyotes playing at the mouth of a ravine. Overhead
swung an eagle which could study from its height every
crack in the surface of the plain, and note his foes and
his intended prey. In the sage bush of the mesa and the
willows along the creeks little birds were swinging and
chattering merrily.</p>

<p>Up one long swell they rode and looked across to one
still higher. From there, which seemed scarcely more
than a mile away, they felt sure they must be able to
view a vast stretch of country. Perhaps they could even
see the wonderful sacred mountain. But that and another
of these deceitful swells of the Western sea of
sand and grass and sedge were passed without thought
of turning back, and then Mrs. Avery exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! see there! It is a castle!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, sure enough, there ahead of them, surmounting
another of those &#8220;heights of land&#8221; or &#8220;divides,&#8221; gleaming,
vari-colored in the sunlight, stood what at first
glance might have been mistaken for some old-world
castle of colossal size.</p>

<p>The lieutenant pulled his horse to a standstill and
gazed in wonder and admiration.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>&#8220;It is the sacred mountain,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;And
who can wonder that the simple savage peoples it with
the children of his fancy, and tells among the tribes
the dream of some romantic red yarn-spinner! We
must go nearer and bring away some souvenirs to show,
along with our description of this wonderful mountain
palace and its pretty Indian legend.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode on, causing their horses to leap gaping
seams in the crust, and, after considerable difficulty,
mounted the broad base which looked like an esplanade
surrounding the citadel.</p>

<p>The commanding view of the country was delightful
and the young couple lingered long in admiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind a bluff two miles to the westward,
a score of mounted Indians swung into view.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant glanced at his bride and turned
pale. Could their horses outfoot the wiry Indian war
ponies? He feared the worst, and his throat grew
parched as he pictured the fate of his wife in the hands
of these red fiends.</p>

<p>The young woman had seen and understood. She
looked confidently into the eyes of her husband. She had
no fear, but the look she saw in his eyes sent a little
quaver to her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us get away as quickly as possible,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Perhaps they have not seen us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew better, and as he lifted her to the saddle she
felt his hand tremble.</p>

<p>For a half mile over the broken surface their progress
was necessarily slow&mdash;and how rapidly those red
devils lessened the intervening space!</p>

<p>The lieutenant pointed to a distant bluff and told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
companion to keep her eyes fixed on that and &#8220;ride&mdash;ride!
ride, as you never rode before!&#8221;</p>

<p>Swinging in behind her, Avery unslung his carbine
and looked to the magazine. It was full.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight Indians!&#8221; he whispered to himself, &#8220;and there
are twenty-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked to his revolver&mdash;&#8220;five more; still there are
nine!&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt for his knife&mdash;&#8220;could he last till nine were
down, if&mdash;if he held her image in his mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow he felt that even death could not conquer
if her life and honor were at stake.</p>

<p>Into the hardened frame of the college athlete he felt
the steel of &#8220;I <i>must</i> win&#8221; creeping.</p>

<p>He watched the oncoming yelling horde and measured
with trained eye their proportional gain.</p>

<p>He glanced at the fair one, who was riding so nobly,
and then he saw red. His nerves became like piano
wires and his muscles like bands of steel.</p>

<p>Presently he urged his horse forward until nearly
neck and neck with that of his bride. He reached over
and touched her soft, white hand and looked into her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride, Dottie! For Heaven&#8217;s sake ride, and let nothing
stir you from the saddle! Don&#8217;t spare the horse!
Don&#8217;t be alarmed if they begin to shoot, and don&#8217;t look
back, whatever you do! Remember, Dot; don&#8217;t look
back! I am going to stop some of their ponies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he dropped back and watched their pursuers.</p>

<p>Now the savages were trying their rifles, but the distance
was yet too great.</p>

<p>He allowed Dot to gain rapidly on him, and then
suddenly pulling his horse to a dead stand, he wheeled
and threw his carbine to his shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>As the first cartridge exploded a pony leaped sidewise
and fell headlong. Its rider rolled over and over,
trampled upon by those bounding after.</p>

<p>Again the carbine spoke and a red man threw up
his arms and plunged from the back of his pony.</p>

<p>The lieutenant now put spurs to his steed and raced
madly after the brave little woman in advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six more and then&mdash;then they&#8217;ll have to come nearer
for their medicine,&#8221; murmured the lieutenant, as he lovingly
patted his carbine.</p>

<p>Bullets now sprinkled plentifully about them, and without
pausing in his headlong flight, Avery responded,
now and then, by dropping a red man from the saddle.</p>

<p>How long could his wife&#8217;s horse hold out at this killing
pace? That was uppermost in his mind. His own
noble animal was fast becoming winded.</p>

<p>He knew that only half the distance to the fort was
covered. If he only could hold the fiends in check
until she was beyond their reach, it was all he would
ask.</p>

<p>He wondered if the clatter of the rifles behind and
rain of bullets had sent terror to her heart.</p>

<p>She held the same poise and she had not once looked
back. If he could only offer her a few words of comfort.</p>

<p>And then came the final catastrophe! Even as he
gazed lovingly at the trim little figure in the saddle
her horse plunged into a prairie dog&#8217;s hole and fell
with a broken leg.</p>

<p>The fair rider struck the ground and lay as if dead.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Avery threw himself from the saddle and
his horse dashed on. His wife&#8217;s animal was thrashing
about pitifully and threatening momentarily to flounder
upon that beloved form.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s one for you, poor little Fan!&#8221; he said, pulling
his revolver and shooting the suffering horse through
the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I must save one for you, too, Dot,&#8221; he said,
to the inanimate form of his wife, as he picked her up
and placed her behind the body of the horse where the
Indian bullets could not reach her.</p>

<p>Kneeling there, the carbine now began to talk rapidly
and several more ponies galloped away riderless.</p>

<p>He did not mind the bullets spatting about him in the
sand and into the carcass of the horse&mdash;they could not
reach her.</p>

<p>Yes, he could feel a burning sensation in his shoulder;
a red-hot band suddenly encircled his body; blood
was running into his eyes from a &#8220;scratch&#8221; on the head,
somewhere.</p>

<p>The carbine was empty now and the revolver came into
play. That, too, was empty except for one chamber&mdash;he
had carefully kept count.</p>

<p>The savages were almost upon him, yelling, shooting,
wielding knives and tomahawks, as he arose to his
full height and drew his last weapon, his knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re too many for me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but they shall
not have you, Dot!&#8221; and he took careful aim at the white,
upturned brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saved this for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence and the deed were never completed, for
a bullet sent him headlong, as the red riders swarmed
about.</p>

<small>AN AGED INDIAN&#8217;S STORY.</small></h2></div>


<p>To the mysterious maid of the Castle Rock, Buffalo
Bill and his pards owed their escape from a long, hard
flight or a desperate fight with a strong war party of
Cheyennes. They reached the river at the point indicated
by the girl, and by crossing and galloping away behind
the timber growth along the bank, escaped the sharp
eyes of the savages.</p>

<p>But the scout and his pards were not to pass the day
without its quota of excitement.</p>

<p>It was past midday when the party rode around a
bend in the river and came upon a child crying bitterly.
It was an Indian girl, and when they came upon her so
suddenly she was terrified. She expected to be put to
torture, evidently.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dismounted and spoke kindly to the child.
She could speak no English, but the scout caught the
Sioux tongue and learned that she lived alone with
an old Indian who was ill and unable to hunt, and they
were starving.</p>

<p>The scout asked the child to lead the way to her companion,
which she at first refused to do, fearing that
the white warriors would kill him. Buffalo Bill assured
her that he would give them food, and perhaps he
could cure the sick man.</p>

<p>She at last led the way into a dense thicket by the
river bank where a rude tepee had been erected, and
inside they found an aged Indian whose eyes glared defiantly
at the white scout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8220;How,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The Indian grunted, then asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why come see red man die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came so you would not die; we bring food for
you and the papoose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the white man want?&#8221; demanded the Indian,
somewhat mollified by the promise of food.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, but to aid the red brother, who is sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted the Sioux incredulously.</p>

<p>The child was chewing pemmican now, taken from the
haversack of Wild Bill, and the sight of it seemed to
soften the old Indian.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill now went outside and with Wild Bill
and Skibo began preparing their own evening meal,
while Nomad, Cayuse, and the boy kept watch against
surprise.</p>

<p>Over the fire some of the pemmican was simmered
until a sweet, warm broth was made and well seasoned
with pepper, which appeals to the Indian taste, and a
dipperful taken to the old Indian. As he sipped it the
fire died out of his eyes and he said gratefully to the
scout:</p>

<p>&#8220;Long Hair heap kind; old Indian no good: lost
um medicine; banished; tribe go away; only papoose
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your tribe once live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they never come here now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Indian shook his head sadly. &#8220;Never look
here now. Long Hair no watchum; Sioux no come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you banished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost um medicine; too old hunt; left um die with
papoose. Old squaw die, young find um young
chief, likeum better, no work for Black Coyote.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>It was a tragedy of the children of the plain, but
rendered doubly so by the abandonment of this little
child to starve when the old Indian should fail to provide
food.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was puzzled. To leave this pair to the
fate which must soon overtake them, even if he provided
food for the present, was manifestly inhuman. To
take them with him to Fort Phil Kearney seemed impossible,
owing to the infirm condition of the old man;
neither could he bear to separate the pair, each of which
was all the other had.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far to Fort Kearney?&#8221; he asked of the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;One sun walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they know Black Coyote there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far to sacred mountain where the moon child
lives?&#8221; asked the scout abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Long Hair know?&#8221; asked the Indian, without
change of countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she is there; I have seen her and talked with
her&mdash;what does Black Coyote know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know heap: dare not tell; queen of stars keep Black
Coyote out happy hunting ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The queen of the stars,&#8221; said the scout, &#8220;is a woman.
She is tender and would have pity for the Indian baby.
She will shut Black Coyote out of the happy hunting
ground if he lets the papoose starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian hesitated. The scout had placed the matter
in a new light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would Long Hair tell the pale queen of the stars
about papoose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Black Coyote will tell Long Hair about the
moon girl.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>After a time, when the fire had died down and the
scout&#8217;s pards were silently smoking in camp near by,
and the child had gone to sleep in the tepee, its hunger
satisfied&mdash;while Buffalo Bill and the aged Indian were
sitting alone in the darkness, the latter told the story
of the &#8220;queen of the stars,&#8221; the &#8220;child of the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>In substance it was that years before a little child
had been stolen by a band of Kiowas who had murdered
her parents. Later the chief who had the child became
alarmed, because of persistent inquiries by the government
agent, who suspected him and threatened to cut
off his allowance from the government, and sold the
little yellow-haired girl to a Cheyenne warrior for two
ponies.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne a year later sold the child to a Sioux
chief for five ponies, and the tribe soon discovered supernatural
attributes. With the colored figments of the
squaws the child made pictures that &#8220;deceived the eye&#8221;
and sang in a way that charmed the great chiefs of
the tribe.</p>

<p>And then one day, with a white woman who had
long been a prisoner, the child walked out of camp and
defied all the warriors to detain them. She pointed to
the moon and said she was its child and came to watch
over the red men and they must not dispute her. She
pointed her finger at the medicine man, looked sternly
at him and walked toward him. He shrank before
her.</p>

<p>The old Indian told how the child, followed by the
woman, went to the mountain and knocked with a stick
upon its side, and the mountain opened and swallowed
up both child and woman, and closed again.</p>

<p>Next evening the child was heard singing in a voice
that hushed the universe, and when the people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tribe drew near they saw her walking on the very top of
the mountain and pointing to the stars. Again she told
them she was daughter of the moon and queen of the
stars, and sang to them.</p>

<p>The Indians left rich offerings of food and blankets
before the rocks that had swallowed up the girl and
woman.</p>

<p>Thereafter when the new moon appeared other offerings
of food and blankets were made, and the custom
had continued until it became a tribal law.</p>

<p>The story of the child spread to other tribes, particularly
to the Cheyennes who had sold her to the Sioux.
The Cheyennes made long pilgrimages each year to
make offerings, swear allegiance and hear the sweet
voice of the child once held by their tribe.</p>

<p>From the Cheyennes the Kiowas learned of the child&#8217;s
power, and they, too, came to pay tribute each year.</p>

<p>The aged red man became flowery and eloquent as
he described the beauty of the young woman who dazzled
the sun with the light of her face, and those who
saw her smile carried happiness ever after. She walked
alone in the forest, and great bears and bull buffaloes lay
down for her in mute homage. Her touch soothed
the hottest fever, and if the red man must not live any
longer she asked of the gods that he die happily and enter
the happy hunting grounds.</p>

<p>This young woman came and went among the red folk
and her word was law and her slightest wish was
granted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of the white woman who went away
with the child?&#8221; asked Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injun no see um again: all same fly &#8217;way to people
where come,&#8221; the Indian had replied solemnly.</p>

<p>The scout terminated his interview, promising to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
food enough for the old Indian and child until he could
come again. He must first go to the fort, but might
soon return and would visit the daughter of the moon.</p>

<p>Next morning with Hickok the scout set out and soon
returned each with an antelope. These were left to supply
the old man and child until they came back. They
also left tea and tobacco.</p>

<small>THE QUEEN OE THE STARS.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Lieutenant Avery went down in the midst of
the yelling horde a brave leaped from his pony and seized
the hair of the young soldier, while another clutched the
long tresses of the unconscious woman. But the eager
ones were halted by an elder chief. Both prisoners must
be taken to the Indian village, he told them, to trade
for prisoners held by the pony soldiers. If the young
officer was dead, he was brave, and the white men
would give a live war prisoner for the body, but it must
not be mutilated.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was not dead, and before the party
had traversed many miles he was raving in delirium.</p>

<p>The bride remained blissfully unconscious.</p>

<p>As the sun hung low in the western sky it shone upon
the Indian party and its prisoners passing near the sacred
mountain, and they paused to leave the first antelope
shot during the trip to insure good luck for the
remainder.</p>

<p>A voice from the top of the rock in their own tongue
asked the Indians concerning their prisoners. They
told her of the long chase and capture, after a fight in
which ten braves had been killed and several horses.
They paid a tribute to the valor of the prisoner and the
beauty of the woman.</p>

<p>The queen of the stars then pointed to the setting sun,
which was going down blood red, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The god of day blushes for the Cheyennes who make
war on women.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sang beautifully in an unknown tongue to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and then ordered them to ride on and leave the prisoners
beside the antelope.</p>

<p>The red warriors obeyed without demur and rode on
sadly, bearing their dead, and with no trophy of the
chase.</p>

<p>The bride had recovered and was moaning over her
delirious and apparently dying husband. He was shot
and cut in many places, while she had escaped without
a scratch.</p>

<p>Suddenly a rock near her slid aside, and two women
came forth&mdash;the fair being who had addressed the war
party, and an elderly one. They at once set about removing
the wounded man to the interior of the mountain.
They also dragged the antelope within, and the
surprised Mrs. Dorothy Avery found herself behind the
wall of solid rock, and in the most marvelous place she
had ever seen or ever expected to see.</p>

<p>The first care of the three women was to dress the
numerous wounds of the lieutenant. All night long three
pairs of tender hands worked over him, and when the
sun arose it lighted the interior of the mountain, and reflected
on the tepee where the young soldier was sleeping
quietly.</p>

<p>To make other incidents of this narrative clear, it is
necessary to give some little description of this home
in the interior of a mountain which any one might imagine,
but few be fortunate enough to see.</p>

<p>To begin with, the mountain, which appeared to be
a solid, square-sided, flat-topped rock from the plain,
was hollow. The great interior cavity sank to a level
with the river two miles away, and the water in a clear
pool along the edge of the south wall arose and fell with
that in the river. The whole bottom seemed made up
of rich loam and where not cultivated in vegetables, corn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
herbs, and flowers, was clothed with green and luxuriant
grass.</p>

<p>Down here, walled in by walls many rods thick, impenetrable
alike to heat and cold, the temperature was
pleasingly equable. It was never hot, yet vegetation
thrived, mostly on reflection of the sun&#8217;s rays. It was
never very cold, for the falling snow melted before it
touched the soil. There were no high winds, and blizzards
and cyclones were never felt.</p>

<p>On the north side of the interior was a massive pile
of rocks of all sizes, as if they had been poured there
from some gigantic measure. On these it was possible
to ascend to the very top of the mountain.</p>

<p>The entrance was by way of what apparently had been
in some other age the bed of a river, and the small
outer opening led into a crevasse where the girl&#8217;s first
disappearance had so puzzled the Indians. The moving
aside of a small rock revealed the opening, which
was nearly filled with loose stones of all sizes. Once
on the inside and the key rock in place, others could
be piled upon it until it was safe from attacks.</p>

<p>The girl, while a prisoner, had accidentally discovered
the opening and had explored it alone without telling
even her friend, the white woman prisoner. Later,
when they had the opportunity, the woman was told and
they laid plans to escape.</p>

<p>Stores of provision and seed were hidden there by
the child on secret trips. Then she had conceived the
plan of playing upon the superstitions of the red people.
Her ruse was successful, due almost wholly to her
sweet voice, and the fact that she had remarkable artistic
talent.</p>

<p>For ten years the couple had lived there, neither caring
greatly to find their way back to civilization. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
woman&#8217;s entire family had been murdered when she was
made prisoner; the girl had been so young when captured
that she knew nothing of her people or their
fate.</p>

<p>Thus they had lived on together very happily.</p>

<p>These women had found solace in raising vegetables
and flowers, for water was always plentiful in the pool
and of good quality. The younger had gone much
among the Indians, but the elder had never left the
walled-in space and only on rare occasions had she
climbed the rocks to the top, to view the world beyond.
She had learned, during her captivity, many of
the Indian methods of treating the sick and wounded,
and, discarding the fanatical and appeals to the elements,
the use of prayer-sticks, etc., she was skilled in
the selection of herbs, and raised them in the beautiful
little garden which thrived nearly all the year.</p>

<p>For several days at least two of the women always
hung over the cot of the wounded lieutenant, while the
other slept. With cool water, fans, and aperient drinks,
they kept the fever down, and at the end of a week
Lieutenant Avery was on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>And then began as strange a life as a soldier probably
ever enjoyed, for Lieutenant Avery did enjoy it. Indeed,
how could he help it? With his bride ever at his
side and his every wish anticipated, who can blame him
if his period of convalescence was somewhat prolonged.
At times little pangs of conscience pricked the young
officer, who felt that the small force at the old fort
needed him in these troublous times. But he was soon
enticed to wait yet a little while until he was stronger,
and his numerous wounds should give him less of pain
and weakness.</p>

<p>Later the strength of the young man began to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
back and with it a desire for activity. He busied himself
in the garden and improved the crude tools of wood
which they used in the cultivation of the soil. He enlarged
the area cultivated, and, with the ever-present
Dot and the other young woman almost constantly with
them, they watched the growth of every flower and bud.</p>

<p>At evening the quartette spent many happy hours, the
lieutenant and his wife telling the others about the
wonders of the great outer world, and in turn enjoying
the tales of the red-skinned people and their manners
and customs.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes had given the child prisoner the name
of Little Moonbeam, but the woman, who said her name
was Mrs. Sherley, called the girl Mona, the name of
one of her own dead daughters.</p>

<p>The Indians had accepted the name Mona as the white
man&#8217;s short for Moonbeam and had not objected to Mrs.
Sherley&#8217;s adoption of it. Thus the girl was called Mona,
and the Averys immediately affixed Sherley for a surname,
in honor of the motherly soul who had been robbed
of all that was dear to her.</p>

<p>At the top of the mountain in some of the clear, moonlit
evenings, Mona sang in her marvelous voice to the
others, and Mrs. Dot, with tears in eyes, said it was
no wonder the simple red folk worshiped the girl. They
were songs of the old frontier days, and hymns that
had been taught her by Mrs. Sherley; and to these the
girl had added some of the mythical verse of the Indians,
for which she had improvised quaint and weird
airs that lent rare enchantment to them, especially to the
savages themselves.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and his wife never appeared at the top
of the butte until after the keen eyes of Mona had carefully
swept the horizon and every part of the plain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
signs of Indians. She did not wish to dispel any part of
her power over these people of the plains, and wished
that the departure of the couple should be as secret as
if their lives depended upon it.</p>

<p>In spite of the happy years the girl had spent here,
the coming of this young couple had opened up new
vistas which she had begun to try and understand.
Their stories of the beautiful world beyond, with its love
and its tears, awakened new emotions. The love of this
girl called Dot, and near her own age, for her handsome
warrior husband was a revelation to this physically marvelous
flower of femininity. She began to question herself
if in the world beyond the plains there was not such
love in store for her.</p>

<p>Oh, the mysteries and miracles of the tender emotions!
How soft and insidious their grasp, yet how tenacious.
In a few short weeks the life of this child of nature
had been taught the pangs and aspirations of the world.</p>

<p>With the coming of Lieutenant and Mrs. Avery, Mona
had experienced her first desires for education&mdash;that
something, acquired from books and teachers which controls
the world. She never tired of the fascinating relation
of college incidents by Dot, or of Lieutenant
Avery&#8217;s laughable experiences in the great university.</p>

<p>But how could she attain them? In this strange
place &#8220;the world,&#8221; which, it seemed to her, was just beyond
the skyline, she understood that everything was
attained by money&mdash;how could she first obtain the
money?</p>

<p>Already Mona was spending sleepless nights, never
known before, because of this, her first touch with civilization.
As yet she had said nothing to Mrs. Sherley or
her new-found friends, but she could not long hide her
troubles.</p>

<small>THE SCOUT ON A DIM TRAIL.</small></h2></div>


<p>At Fort Phil Kearney Buffalo Bill found orders based
on the reports and recommendations of General Sheridan
and other officers that he be assigned to the duty of
learning the fate, if possible, of Lieutenant Avery and
his bride.</p>

<p>The scout&#8217;s orders were in detail, so far as the department
understood the case, but he was given much latitude
for his own judgment and experience. From the
officer in command of the fort he learned every assignment
of the young officer since he left the military
academy; the report of his trip to Bozeman and his marriage;
under whose command he had been, and of all
officers who might in any way have become jealous of
the preference of Avery over themselves. He also heard
of the young officer&#8217;s difficulties at Bozeman and of the
thrashing of the Indian agent, Price.</p>

<p>The scout was delighted with that part of Avery&#8217;s
career which included the trouncing of Price.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have enjoyed that privilege myself,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>Prevailing rumors of Lieutenant Avery&#8217;s troubles in
the East also came to Buffalo Bill&#8217;s ears, and he immediately
set about tracing them to their source. He
heard of the return of the lieutenant&#8217;s horse, and the
hint of a ruse to deceive those at the fort.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill decided shortly that Lieutenant Avery
and his girl wife had either been killed or captured by
Indians, or had fallen victims to the jealousy and hatred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of a certain element in the army. From the persistence
of the poisonous rumors he feared that rank treachery
among his brother officers had led to the tragedy.</p>

<p>The scout determined to sift the matter to the bottom,
wherever the blame might fall. He relied implicitly on
the good sense and nerve of Wild Bill. His other pards
were all trustworthy in intention, but he feared they
might make a break inadvertently that would put certain
army officers on their guard.</p>

<p>The very next day after the arrival of the scout and
his pards at the fort a party of cavalry had found the
carcass of the horse ridden by Mrs. Avery. Plenty of
evidence that the horse had been running toward the fort
when it plunged into the prairie dog&#8217;s hole and broke
a leg was discoverable.</p>

<p>The scout decided to visit the scene with his pards.
Under special instructions, Wild Bill was left at the fort
to play cards and drink with the officers. The scout believed
Hickok might hear references to the case which
would prove of value later on. He wished also to know
the general feeling among the officers and among the
men toward Lieutenant Avery.</p>

<p>No man was better prepared to obtain such material
than the magnetic Wild Bill. All the officers and most
of the men knew the reputation of both the scout and
Wild Bill, but few of them had ever seen the latter.</p>

<p>Wild Bill, standing six feet two in stockings, and built
&#8220;from the ground up,&#8221; was a man of perfect poise, physically
and mentally. He was quiet, conservative, and
unobtrusive in manner, never given to boasting or indulging
in expletives, his strongest expression being &#8220;by
gorry.&#8221; In fact, Wild Bill was the exact opposite of
the typical frontiersman.</p>

<p>Wild Bill loved to play cards, and only the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
abuse or cheating could make him lose his temper, and
then a few quiet words from him had settled many disputes
that otherwise would have ended in tragedy.</p>

<p>Old Nomad paid this tribute to his pard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hickok seldom gits mad, but when he does, look out!
He don&#8217;t say very much, but when he opens up ev&#8217;ry
word weighs er ton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wild Bill&#8217;s reputation as a dead shot had penetrated
every company of the army, and when the officers saw
the tall, wiry, iron-nerved, steel-eyed scout they believed
every word they had heard of his prowess. No
man on the frontier, with the single exception of Buffalo
Bill, was held so much in awe as was Wild Bill Hickok
in those days, and with good cause.</p>

<p>In the finer, keener qualities of mental make-up only
did the scout lead his famous pard. Buffalo Bill possessed
an analytical mind and a natural mathematical
sagacity. Wild Bill was practical, level-headed, and
keen; quick as a flash in mind and body, and fear was
minus in his make-up; but he deferred to his leader in
matters of difficult solution.</p>

<p>The coyotes had stripped the bones of Mrs. Avery&#8217;s
horse, but Buffalo Bill examined them critically. He
could discover no other evidence of wound than the
broken leg and bullet hole in the head. The bullet had
not passed entirely through the skull of the animal, and
with a hatchet he removed it. It showed to be a bullet
from a .44-calibre army revolver. This was good evidence
that Lieutenant Avery had shot the animal himself,
after it had broken a leg. That the animal had
been running toward the fort at the time of the accident
was plain.</p>

<p>And right then the scout&#8217;s opinion of Lieutenant
Avery advanced many per cent. A man who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
pause under such stress as was apparent at the time of
the accident to put a suffering animal out of its misery
was no coward.</p>

<p>The scout believed also that right then and there the
officer had dismounted from his own horse, which had
galloped away, leaving the young couple afoot on the
plain. Who took them away?&mdash;that was the part that
must be unraveled. If treachery had been practiced,
some one must suffer; if the officer and his bride had
been captured they must be rescued; if dead, their bodies
must be given decent burial.</p>

<p>The next step must be taken from the carcass of the
horse. The scout held a consultation with Cayuse, beyond
earshot of the military escort which had come to
point out the place where Mrs. Avery had been thrown
and her horse had ended its days.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse went down on the ground, while the
others retired for some distance toward the fort and
left him alone. Over and over the ground he went, each
time broadening his circle, while the others smoked and
watched.</p>

<p>At last the Piute began moving away across the plain,
slowly at first and then faster, until he was going at
that tireless lope which only an Indian trailer can follow.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dismissed the army men, caught up Navi&#8217;s
lariat, and with his pards galloped after.</p>

<p>The cavalrymen, as they rode away, turned in their
saddles and watched the progress of the strange procession
as long as they could see them, and then hastened
on to the fort to report.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looky hyar, Buffler; et strikes me we&#8217;re gittin&#8217; inter
fermiliar territory&mdash;don&#8217;t et yeou?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; there is the rock where the yellow-haired girl
hailed us,&#8221; answered the scout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;An&#8217; Cayuse is goin&#8217; plumb centre at et,&#8221; continued the
trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we intended to come this way sometime, and
we got around sooner than we expected,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mars&#8217; Billyum,&#8221; broke in Skibo, &#8220;Ah reckon yo&#8217; eyes
am better dan dis yeah niggah&#8217;s&mdash;don&#8217; yo&#8217; see sumpin&#8217;
atop o&#8217; dat mounting?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout looked, and then pulled his field glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;There certainly is quite an important something
there, Skibo. It is no less than our yellow-haired girl of
beauty and mystery. Perhaps she&#8217;ll invite us to lunch,
Skibo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! Mebbe she do, Mars&#8217; Billyum; but Ah
specs it&#8217;ll take a pow&#8217;ful lot o&#8217; floppin&#8217; for dat dar Nomad
to fly up to dat high roost ob hern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer jes&#8217; look out fer yer own floppin&#8217;, Mr. Skibo&mdash;who
ever hearn tell o&#8217; a nigger with wings, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess if I could get up there with my bugle, Miss
Yellow Hair and I could make the Indians look silly,&#8221;
said Tootsie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thar ye go ergin! Course ye&#8217;ll begin ter make
plans, fust thing, ter git up thar ermong ther pretty gals.
Like ernough ther mounting ez full er yaller-haired angels,&#8221;
teased Nomad.</p>

<p>As they rode nearer Buffalo Bill saw that the girl on
the mountain top was signaling to them. He could not
understand what she was trying to convey. He thought
of Indians approaching from beyond, but he could not
understand the girl&#8217;s apparent perturbation. She ran
back and forth on the rock, and waved a cloth at them,
and then looked and pointed away beyond their view,
on the other side of the mountain.</p>

<p>When they had reached hailing distance they pulled
their horses to a standstill, and heard the girl cry:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&#8220;Go back! Go back! A party of Indians are approaching
from the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly a score,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only four to one,&#8221; said the scout; &#8220;we have come on
an important mission, and if they mean fight we will entertain
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sir, I beg you to go back. They are Sioux and
bent on mischief, I feel sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How near are they?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes&#8217; ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; it is only two minutes&#8217; ride for us to the
crevasse south of your castle, and once in there we are
willing for them to try their mischief on us. We thank
you, just the same, for your kindly warning. And again
we thank you for your advice the other day; it saved
us lots of trouble and brought us in contact with a child
and an old man in whom you may be interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; the girl asked, although she was
manifestly nervous for the safety of the scout and his
pards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Black Coyote and his little daughter have been abandoned
to starve by their tribe. I will tell you more when
I have time; just now I wish to get my men and horses
where they will be protected from Sioux bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By ther great horn spoon an&#8217; granny&#8217;s ole tin ladle!
I c&#8217;u&#8217;d lick twenty Sioux all alone ef she&#8217;d luk on an&#8217;
cheer fer ole Nick,&#8221; announced Nomad, as he galloped
along behind the scout.</p>

<p>The party was barely well below the jagged walls of
the fissure when along the base of the cone thundered
the war party of Sioux.</p>

<p>The Indians had seen the white riders enter the cleft
some distance below the mountain where the walls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
not so high or precipitous. They saw, too, the strategical
advantages of the position, and were careful to turn aside
when they saw five rifles protruding over the top of the
wall and pointing in their direction.</p>

<p>The Indians halted, and one rode on in front a short
distance and then began riding in a circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to hold a parley,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed et?&#8221; answered the trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll meet him,&#8221; said the scout, setting down
his rifle and looking to his revolvers and knife. He led
Bear Paw to the place where they had entered, clambered
out on top, and mounted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef they &#8217;tempt any funny bus&#8217;ness we&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter
make um think et&#8217;s rainin&#8217; red-hot bullets,&#8221; shouted
Nomad.</p>

<p>The chief who came forward was well mounted, and
advanced with a genial:</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; answered the scout, riding up to the Indian
and extending his hand.</p>

<p>Like a flash the Indian&#8217;s knife came out, and he struck
at the heart of the scout.</p>

<p>But as other treacherous Indians had done before him,
this one had miscalculated. He built too much upon his
own prowess, and underestimated that of his antagonist.</p>

<p>Bear Paw was away like a flash, and then back again
with a lunge that knocked the Indian pony almost off its
feet. At the same instant the scout struck the chief&#8217;s
arm a blow that sent his knife flying through the air,
and, lifting the savage bodily from the saddle, hurled
him backward to the sun-hardened mesa, stunned.</p>

<p>But at sight of this the entire party charged upon the
daring white man, and the battle was on.</p>

<p>The scout put spurs to Bear Paw and dashed back toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the cleft where his companions were hidden, at the
same time, turning in the saddle, he poured several shots
from his revolvers into the scattering, yelling, shooting
savages.</p>

<p>Old Nomad, Skibo, Cayuse, and Tootsie let loose a
galling fire from their rifles, and the charge was of brief
duration.</p>

<p>As the Indians wheeled and dashed away beyond the
range of the rifles, Tootsie sounded the &#8220;advance&#8221; on
his bugle.</p>

<p>The Indians immediately huddled together, gesticulating
and talking excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give um ernother sample o&#8217; yer tootin&#8217;, Tootsie,&#8221; said
Nomad.</p>

<p>The boy responded sharply on his horn, keeping well
out of sight, and the Indians were puzzled as to its
source. From their actions the scout judged that it
sounded to them as if it came from the top of the butte.
They pointed and looked in that direction, and then back
toward the fissure where the party of whites and their
horses were hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess if I had my ghost fixed up it would finish the
job,&#8221; said Tootsie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe some o&#8217; them aire ther same fellers ye s&#8217;luted
berfore,&#8221; suggested Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try them with another &#8216;advance,&#8217;&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>This was sufficient. The Indians wheeled their horses
and dashed away, in half an hour disappearing beyond
a mound of the rolling plain to the west.</p>

<p>The pards were so intently watching the Indians that
they heard no sound until a voice beside them said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, sir, may I ask about the old Indian,
Black Coyote, and his child?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pards doffed their hats with amusing celerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and Buffalo Bill, stepping forward, introduced himself
and the members of his party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Pa-e-has-ka, the Long Hair, of whom I have
heard so much?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Buffalo Bill among the white people of the
West,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and the Indians have called me
Pa-e-has-ka.&#8221;</p>

<p>She extended her hand to him and then to the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am &#8216;Little Moonbeam&#8217; to the red people,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and my only white friend, Mrs. Sherley, calls me Mona.
The red folk regard me as daughter of the moon and
queen of the stars, because my goings and comings mystify
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I don&#8217;t blame ther Injuns, nuther!&#8221; interjected
Nomad, unable to conceal his admiration.</p>

<p>The scout then told of the aged Indian and little girl,
and their pitiful condition. If some one did not watch
over them, he told her, they would soon starve. Black
Coyote had told him of the queen of the stars, and had
expressed the desire, which he seemed to think hopeless,
that he might communicate with her before he should die.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed to think the daughter of the moon would
care for his helpless child,&#8221; the scout added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see him before the sun comes over the hills
again,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we not escort you to the tepee of Black Coyote?&#8221; the
scout asked.</p>

<p>She smiled indulgently, and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be far safer alone, and I could find the
tepee of Black Coyote in the blackest night, although he
does not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you knew of their troubles,&#8221; suggested the
scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he was well and provided with buffalo meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the last time I was there&mdash;but I have been very busy
of late and have not paid them a visit,&#8221; she answered,
as if regretting the neglect.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you cannot well go to see him now I will visit
him in the morning and provide food for several days,
and tell them you are coming,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shall go very soon, although I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; it is for you to choose. But we are at
your service, my pards and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have performed the errand for Black
Coyote you had better make haste back to the fort,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a far more important errand,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I am interested in?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so; listen: Several weeks ago a brave young
soldier, recently married to a girl almost as lovely as
yourself, went out to ride from the fort. They never
came back, and their people and the Great Father at
Washington are grieved because of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;For many days the pony soldiers and walkaheaps
have searched the plain for the missing ones. Now the
Great Father has asked me to try to find the young lieutenant.
I have traced him thus far. That is my mission
here. Little Moonbeam, can you give me any word of
encouragement or tell me anything of their fate?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl stood blushing and paling. She was manifestly
disturbed by Pa-e-has-ka&#8217;s recital; but she calmed
herself with an effort, and replied in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-e-has-ka has done well to trace the lost soldier
and his bride so far. If his trailers should be able to
discover it in the much-trodden soil beyond, it would
lead him on. But Pa-e-has-ka will do well to turn back
and wait with patience.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>&#8220;Can Little Moonbeam tell me if both are alive?&#8221; the
scout insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both are alive, although the brave young soldier was
pitifully wounded. But he is recovering, and some day
will be allowed to go back with his bride to their people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask you more?&#8221; queried the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more now,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Go back to the
soldier village, and come again when the moon is round,
and I will tell you more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Black Coyote and the child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give no further thought to them; they shall not
suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Miss Mona, for what you have done,
and I wish you to remember to call on Buffalo Bill or
any of his pards, if you are ever in trouble or we can
in any way be of service to you. Do not hesitate, especially
if you should desire to visit the outside world;
then our advice might save you from many pitfalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you. When I meet you again I may have a
request to make, or, at least, may wish to ask your advice
concerning the future. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away, and the scout and his pards led their
steeds out of the cleft and rode away. They had proceeded
barely a hundred rods when, looking back, they
saw Little Moonbeam waving to them from the mountain
top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t thet make yer guess some?&#8221; exclaimed Nomad.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter see little Yaller Hair when she flies
up thar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impatient, Nick. We are getting acquainted
much faster than we expected. Perhaps she will give
us an exhibition of her a√´rial prowess some day. Restrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
yourself, pard; she is too rare a bird for any of
our cages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s all right, Buffler; but when I see er bird thet
I cyant ketch, et do my eyes good ter look at um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; observed the scout quietly, &#8220;that we are to
have a long, hard ride to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s ther sign, Buffler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A party of horsemen came over a ridge to the north
of the butte and are heading this way. I caught but
a momentary glimpse of them before they disappeared,
but I think they are Sioux and have seen us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, the safest way is usually the best way.
Let each dismount and look to his trappings. A broken
girth with Indians close in chase might mean disaster.
Also carefully examine your rifles and revolvers and
see that everything is in prime condition. One minute&#8217;s
time lost in that way while our animals are puffing may
mean several minutes gain for us in a hot chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that long ridge running quartering to us
about two miles distant? Well, they are now behind
that, and if they think we have not seen them they will
continue behind that and ride like all-possessed to head
us off if we keep on in this direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, when we mount, bear five points or so farther
into the south, and don&#8217;t push your horses until we are
hard pressed, and then we&#8217;ll adopt tactics which will give
the animals a little leeway on the ponies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cayuse, you and Tootsie lead the way and set the
pace&mdash;not too stiff, you know, but a good easy lope for
the animals. There will be time enough to run when
we know we are being chased. Skibo, you follow Cayuse
and the boy, and Nomad and I will bring up the rear
and sort of regulate the speed of our pursuers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the scout called to Cayuse to swing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
harder into the south, so the Indians would not be too
near when they rounded the end of the ridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep to the right and around the end of the ridge
ahead of you, then swing hard into the east again and
make good speed as soon as we are out of sight; but
don&#8217;t look around. If the Indians attempt to ride over
the ridge to cut us off they will wind their ponies, after
what they have been giving them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout had been exactly right in his calculations.
Presently a strong party of perhaps fifty well-mounted
Sioux dashed around the ridge, and apparently expected
to be almost upon the white men, who were as far in the
lead as before, riding easily southward, as if unconscious
of the proximity of red warriors, and without a glance
behind them.</p>

<p>It had been Buffalo Bill&#8217;s orders that all should be
riding unconcernedly and without looking back, so that
the savages would still think themselves unseen.</p>

<p>The Indians sent their ponies away in full pursuit,
hoping to pull well up on the white riders before being
discovered.</p>

<p>The scout had no more than passed from the view of
the Indians around the next ridge before he shouted to
Cayuse:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now get away at good gait, and hard to the left.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Indians at last rounded the end of the
divide they were surprised at the change of course by
their intended victims, and the gain the fugitives had
made on them, and also that the white riders still seemed
to be riding leisurely and were not looking backward.</p>

<p>The whites were now almost at the north end of another
ridge that ran away toward the southwest, and
would soon pass from view.</p>

<p>The Indians suspected that they had been tricked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the seemingly unconcerned white riders. They would not
be fooled so again, and, as soon as the fugitives had
passed out of sight, turned their ponies and urged them
with all speed toward the divide and up its long, wind-breaking
rise.</p>

<p>At last they had reached the top, but instead of discovering
their prey just down the other side, swinging
into the south again, they were nowhere in view.</p>

<p>The Indians were puzzled, but urged their tired ponies
along the high land toward the point where the scout
and his pards had last been seen. At the end of the
bluff the party was still undiscoverable; but there was
their plain trail leading away into the southeast, and
back from behind another ridge, a mile away, came the
clear notes of a bugle.</p>

<p>The red men had been hoodwinked by an old trick of
their own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />

<small>WILD BILL&#8217;S WILD RIDE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Wild Bill made the acquaintance of all the officers and
mingled freely with the men at the fort. From the
latter he soon got several hints regarding the officers,
without seeming to have any desire to do so. One officer,
he discovered at the start, was unpopular with the men
of the ranks, and it soon became evident that this man
was disliked by his brother officers. Wild Bill immediately
made it his business to cultivate the acquaintance
of this man.</p>

<p>For reasons which will be obvious later in this tale,
the true name of this officer will not be given. We will
call him Captain Smith for convenience, simply because
that was not his name.</p>

<p>Captain Smith well knew that he was generally disliked,
and when the distinguished and daring plainsman
appeared to favor his society, the captain hastened to
meet his new-found friend halfway.</p>

<p>In card games that day Hickok found opportunity to
size up all the officers, and skillfully led to some reference
to the missing Lieutenant Avery. In the conversation
that followed he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if this Avery isn&#8217;t the same man I saw up
Callatin way a few moons ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; answered another; &#8220;that is where he
found his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; by the way, he must be the one who had
a falling out with the Indian agent up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Did you meet Price?&#8221; asked Smith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>Wild Bill affected not to exactly remember the name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was this Price the Indian
agent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I met him several times at the hotel&mdash;pleasant
fellow, evidently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet he is; Price is all right,&#8221; avowed Captain
Smith enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The others made no comment.</p>

<p>Wild Bill shuffled the cards and dealt new hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may have this Avery mixed with some other man,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Was he of medium height and fairly stout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; as tall as you are and about your build,&#8221; said
Cook.</p>

<p>Captain Smith opened his mouth to speak, but changed
his mind. Wild Bill noted the captain&#8217;s hesitation and
resolved to give him an opportunity to relieve his mind.</p>

<p>After the game had ended Hickok approached Captain
Smith, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of country is it west of here? Looks like
quite a sizable ca√±on dead west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the Big Horn range, and it&#8217;s a picturesque
country as far as I&#8217;ve been. That is called Carvel&#8217;s
Ca√±on, I think. Just now the foothills are swarming
with Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly; but Olgallalas, Poncas, Otoes, and Cheyennes
are too plentiful for comfort. They are traveling
in strong parties during the last few months, and it is
a hopeless case for the settlers wherever they go. A
cattleman with a few cowboys and good rifles can stand
off the small parties, but these war parties are out for
scalps and plunder, and they will never be quiet until
they are given an everlasting licking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>&#8220;What do you say to a canter out toward the ca√±on,
to see what we may see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would suit me first-rate, if the general doesn&#8217;t
object. He is short of men now, and the supply train,
which is accompanied by fifty men, is five days late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have to turn to buffalo meat pretty soon, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks that way now, and the general is getting uneasy
about the men with the train, as well as the supplies.
He may ask you and Cody to investigate if it
doesn&#8217;t show up pretty soon. And, by the way, Hickok,
would it be impertinent for me to ask what your mission
is here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; answered Wild Bill suavely. &#8220;We
are making for Fort Leavenworth, and Colonel Cody
thought he would look over the forces at the different
forts and see how they compare, according to the districts
they are in and an experienced Indian fighter&#8217;s
notion of the places that would require the stronger
forces. Of course you know that back in the States
there is a good deal of criticism concerning the disposal
of the frontier troops. Some blame the war department
and some the interior department for the stand they take
in opposition to each other. I shouldn&#8217;t like to have you
make any talk about the object of our visit, of course,
but I don&#8217;t mind telling you privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Smith felt flattered by the scout&#8217;s apparent
confidence and became somewhat loquacious.</p>

<p>The general in command asked both to use exceeding
caution and to take no chances. He should prefer if
they were going simply for a gallop that they should
proceed along the route to the southeast, from which
direction he was momentarily expecting the supply train
and escort. If the Indians should discover and capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
this train it would mean disaster for the fort, as the
quantity of ammunition now on hand was small.</p>

<p>It was a pleasing day for a canter, if there were no
necessity of a constant study of the surroundings for
signs of the treacherous reds.</p>

<p>Wild Bill was always on the alert, and his eye was
as quick as that of any Indian. They had left the fort
perhaps three miles in the rear, and Captain Smith had
entered deeply into a subject which interested Hickok.
It was concerning Price, the former Indian agent, and
his affairs, particularly that which concerned Lieutenant
Avery. They saw nothing of the hoped-for supply
wagons, and the scout was so absorbed by the words of
his companion that he at first gave no heed to a row of
strange objects along the crest of a hill far to the left
of them. Then the habit of years fixed his gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see anything there?&#8221; he asked of the captain.</p>

<p>The captain did not, but Hickok leveled his field glass
as he rode, and a moment later announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are Indians, cap, and they are between us and
the fort. How is your horse for a run?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain paled, but answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no pony living that can down him in twenty
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Let&#8217;s look to our saddle girths, for as soon
as those fellows see that they have been discovered they
will come out in full view. They are only waiting now
to give others time to cut off our retreat by riding out
behind that ridge we have just crossed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is best for us to do?&#8221; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep out of their way, if possible, and when they
get too near make it costly for them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve revolver ammunition in plenty, but only half a
dozen rounds for my rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your ammunition for a while, then, and when
they get too insistent I&#8217;ll entertain them. How far is it
to the crest of that ridge, should you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thousand yards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wild Bill raised the sights of his rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch me let them know they are discovered,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Swinging in his saddle, his rifle cracked and dust
flew beside one of those round objects that lay so motionless.</p>

<p>Instantly more than a score of warriors leaped to their
feet and darted back out of sight down the opposite side
of the divide.</p>

<p>&#8220;In two shakes of a sandpeep&#8217;s tail they&#8217;ll be back
again, fully mounted and after us,&#8221; said Hickok. &#8220;Are
you prepared for a run?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, and ready to wager that I can leave those fellows
out of sight in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it, old man. If you do you may sleep
without a scalp to-night. My advice to you is not to
push your horse too hard at first. The farther we get
ahead of them the farther we&#8217;ll be away from the fort
when darkness comes on. So long as there is nothing
in the way, I move that we stick to the route as though
we never intended to come back, and then they won&#8217;t be
looking for us when we return after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming, Hickok!&#8221; exclaimed the captain
excitedly, sending his horse away at a swift canter.</p>

<p>Wild Bill saw the fiercely charging cavalcade now
plunging down the descent and yelling fiercely.</p>

<p>It was a fearsome sight to those unused to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Wild Bill did not blame the captain for being nervous.
He rode near enough to the latter to call to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push your horse too hard at first; hold him
in a bit, and when the reds get too near I&#8217;ll caution
them. Save your horse for later on; also keep your
eyes peeled for an ambush ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smith&#8217;s horse benefited by the advice to his master,
and presently Wild Bill&#8217;s rifle cracked and one of the
pursuers dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Soon the savages eased up their pace, keeping beyond
the range of that unfailing rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;No hurry, cap; just keep going fast enough so they
can&#8217;t drive by and surround us&mdash;but look sharp to the
front.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the captain shouted back at Wild
Bill:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear firing ahead&mdash;sounds like an army engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we mount the next divide we can see. And
say, cap, if it&#8217;s your supply train surrounded in the
valley beyond, put on all speed and dash straight at the
Indian line, shooting and yelling. Ten to one they would
be so surprised at this attack from a new quarter that
they will forget to shoot till we are inside the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode not too rapidly up the rise, the Indians
respecting Hickok&#8217;s rifle sufficiently to keep beyond
range. Wild Bill&#8217;s plan was to save the wind of the
horses until dark, when he knew the Indians would attempt
to surround them.</p>

<p>As they rode out on the crest, Captain Smith exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jupiter! see there.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the little valley below them was the wagon train
huddled on the plain, with the horses in the square between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the wagons, and the escort lying and kneeling all
about the wagons and keeping the Indians at bay. Several
hundred warriors were riding in a circle about the
train, keeping their bodies behind their ponies and shooting
from behind these living shields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight at them now, and begin yelling and shooting
the instant we are discovered,&#8221; said Wild Bill, putting
spurs to his horse.</p>

<small>RESCUE OF THE SUPPLY TRAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill and his pards reached the fort that
night the commander was becoming alarmed because of
the prolonged absence of Captain Smith and Wild Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down the route toward Fort Reno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! they&#8217;ll show up, all right,&#8221; said the scout reassuringly.
&#8220;Hickok is a whole regiment and an ambulance
train combined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but I am getting worried about the supply
train, which ought to have arrived five days ago. Captain
Smith and Wild Bill rode that way, and should have
returned two or three hours ago. What do you think
of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, in that case, that Hickok discovered your
wagon train in difficulties and has gone to their assistance.
If you will give me fifty well-mounted men I
should enjoy going to the relief of your supplies and
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have them, Cody; and the sooner you start
the better it will suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tn spite of his hard day&#8217;s ride, the scout was impatient
to be off. Old Nomad got wind of it and came
tearing up to the officer&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;See hyar! what&#8217;s this aire man&oelig;uvrin&#8217; whar&#8217;s likely
ter be moosic an&#8217; ole Nick hain&#8217;t included, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better go to bed, Nomad; you&#8217;ve had a hard
day,&#8221; said the general soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, me? Me had er hard day? An&#8217; ther prospects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
o&#8217; scrimmagin&#8217; woul&#8217;n&#8217;t rest me! Guess you don&#8217;t know
ole Nick purty good, do ye? Say, gin&#8217;ral, &#8217;f I cyant go
&#8217;th that thar outfit I&#8217;ll lay erwake an&#8217; holler all night,
so&#8217;s yeow an&#8217; nobody else cyant sleep, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general laughed. &#8220;Well, go with Cody, if you expect
to take it so much to heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar, thet&#8217;s more like yore usual ginerosity, gin&#8217;ral.
I knowed ye&#8217;d do et, ef I put it up to yer right. When
Pard Buffler goes anywhar I jest likes ter jog erlong,
&#8217;cause somethin&#8217;s bound ter hap&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad hurried away to saddle Hide-rack, but one of
the officers insisted that the trapper take a fresh horse.
Buffalo Bill, too, was given a splendid mount, and Cayuse,
who could not be left behind, was provided with a
good animal.</p>

<p>There were fifty-three men in the rescue expedition,
with Buffalo Bill, ole Nomad, and Little Cayuse well
in the lead to insure against ambush.</p>

<p>Two hours&#8217; hard riding had shown no signs of a supply
train, or of Hickok and the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will ride for another hour, boys,&#8221; said the scout,
&#8220;and then, if we discover nothing, turn back.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they had not ridden fifteen minutes farther when
the quick ears of Little Cayuse detected the sound of
firing.</p>

<p>The scout halted the line and listened. Distinctly now
there came to their ears the sound of desultory firing, far
to the southeast and beyond what must be quite heavy
ridges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look to your trappings and outfits, boys,&#8221; said the
scout, &#8220;and be ready when we charge to carry all before
us. Give &#8217;em a good lesson this time, and chase them
into the next county.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party took the last long rise easily, husbanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the strength of their horses, and when near the top
paused for the animals to puff and to reconnoitre the
situation.</p>

<p>But by the flashes of the guns and occasional attempts
of the Indians to set the wagons afire by throwing
blazing torches, the conditions were easily understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice, to the north of the wagons, the Indians
are doing everything to attract attention in that
direction?&#8221; asked Buffalo Bill of a lieutenant at his side.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a hundred to one they
are massing to charge on the south side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Move down upon them quietly and get as near as
possible, and then charge to the south of the wagons&mdash;make
things hum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had a bugler and some rocks,&#8221; said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his request, Tootsie appeared at
the withers of the officer&#8217;s horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me do the tooting, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you here?&#8221; exclaimed Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I knew you wouldn&#8217;t let me come if you knew,
and so I sneaked. You&#8217;ll forgive me, won&#8217;t you, Mr.
Cody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boy; get out your bugle and ride beside me.
When I say the word sound the &#8216;charge,&#8217; and then keep
out of the way of the cavalry.&#8221;</p>

<p>So intent were the Indians in carrying out their own
schemes that they knew nothing of the approach of re√´nforcements
for the whites.</p>

<p>Suddenly from out of the darkness, two hundred yards
south of the wagon train, started the thunder of beating
hoofs and the fierce yells of at least three hundred red
warriors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>But almost at the same instant, above the shrill, savage
yells, arose the penetrating notes of the bugle in triumphant
&#8220;charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like an avalanche thundered the half-hundred heavy
cavalry horses, and before the Indians could be fully
aware of their presence the soldiers were upon them.</p>

<p>Tootsie clung to his horse, and when he saw the dark
forms of the savages scudding before him, he fired as
fast as he could pull the trigger of his revolver, and
occasionally added a blast from his bugle.</p>

<p>The boy bugler felt his horse overtake the Indian
ponies and plunge among and over them, and then he
found himself alone on the prairie beyond them, and
heard the continuous crash of revolvers and the clank
and clash of sabres on lances and shields.</p>

<p>He would have emptied his rifle into the black mass,
but he could not tell friend from foe. He had entered
the volcano by the side of Buffalo Bill, but the scout
was back there in the midst of it now, and the boy wondered
how he had been belched out beyond the rim.</p>

<p>Then out by him tore a maddened horde, the first
part of it in full flight and the last part of it spitting
flame and lead at the fugitives and hoarsely cheering as
they rode after, relentlessly cutting down man and beast
of the red marauders.</p>

<p>It was Tootsie&#8217;s first real taste of battle, and though
it was tempered by the kindly gloom, it turned the boy&#8217;s
soul sick&mdash;this useless waste of life, because of what?</p>

<p>Well, older heads than his have tried to reach the
right of this question and failed. But it is always safe to
assume that somebody was wrong, and with greed at the
bottom of it and vengeance to drive it on, the soil of the
great Western plains is soaked in human blood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>For another sickening hour the running battle raged,
with the badly whipped Indians in full flight and their
numbers constantly growing less until the scattered remnants
were lost in the night and darkness had saved
many lives.</p>

<p>Several white men were dead and wounded, and the
train moved on sadly and slowly toward the fort. Buffalo
Bill and his rescue party, led by himself and Nomad,
with Little Cayuse and Tootsie closely following,
were in advance. The scout had been slightly wounded
and old Nomad had received an arrow in the flesh of his
left leg. He also had a cut from a spear on the head,
but he &#8220;never felt better&#8221; in his life, he assured those who
asked regarding his wounds.</p>

<p>It was some time after daylight when the wagon train,
intact, with its escort, reached the fort and relieved the
anxiety of the commander. Buffalo Bill and Hickok
were closeted for a long time with the general that night,
and the latter profusely thanked the scouts for the part
they had taken in saving the wagon train. He stated
frankly that he believed the coming of the scouts to the
fort had saved the supplies and the escort of fifty men, as
well as the two women, wives of officers there, and the
teamsters.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill told the general of his discoveries concerning
Lieutenant Avery and the mysterious &#8220;Queen of
the Stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general was amazed. He looked almost incredulously
at the scout for several moments, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty years ago, when I was living in Ohio, a man
whom I had known from boyhood, Jake Payne, came
home from a varied career in the West. He had always
been wild and irresponsible, and at an early age ran
away from the farm where he had been &#8216;bound out&#8217; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his guardian&mdash;his parents were dead&mdash;and was not seen
in his native town again until he came home to die from
a pistol-shot wound which he said had been given him
by his partner. He told a long story of their hardships
and adventures in the Black Hills and elsewhere, and
how at last they struck it rich. They opened a pocket
and took out many thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of pure
nuggets of gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians became so troublesome that they at last
attempted to steal away with their gold. They feared to
go east through a country they knew then to be swarming
with Indians, and determined to try their luck to
the westward, hoping to fall in with other gold seekers
or a cavalry detachment, or wagon train. They traveled
nights, hiding their trail as much as possible, walking
their mules in the beds of streams for miles and choosing
the hard and dry mesa wherever possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told how they were chased by a party of Crows
one night, and finally surrounded near the base of a
particular butte. Their mules were killed and they
dragged their treasure bags into a fissure and, there entrenched,
held the Indians at bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;They finally discovered a hole in the rocks, and
crawled in with their precious burden and plugged the
hole up after them. At daylight the Indians charged,
and were greatly mystified at their disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;To make a long story short, they found the mountain
to be hollow. It was an absolutely safe retreat, and they
remained some time. Later they buried the principal
part of their treasure, filling their pockets only, and attempted
to make the settlements to the southeast on foot.
This they had nearly accomplished when a dispute arose
between them regarding the final disposal of their gold,
and a shooting affair resulted. Both were fatally injured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Payne finally reaching the nearest settlement, his
partner dying on the plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Payne described the mountain and hiding place of
the gold to me, and I believe your sacred mountain is the
place.&#8221;</p>

<small>A SET-TO WITH A GRIZZLY.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill had decided, while awaiting the day of his
appointment with Little Moonbeam, to scout a bit in the
mountains to the west of the fort. He believed there
were Indian villages located in the fastnesses of the Big
Horn range, and from these the numerous war parties
sallied forth on their expeditions of plunder and rapine.
If these villages could be discovered, and the Indians
punished and driven back to their reservations, the lives
and property of many settlers might be saved.</p>

<p>The scout was convinced that the raids were mostly
to be laid at the door of a few daring and bloodthirsty
chiefs like Rain-in-the-face. If these leaders could be
captured and punished, the cause of peace would be promoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, ov all ther ringtail-peelin&#8217;, sidehill loungers I
ever seen, ther b&#8217;ar thet tore round hyar wuz ther plumb
biggest. Look et thet paw mark, Buffler, an&#8217; see what

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! dat ain&#8217; nuffin, Nick. Why! down in ole
Virginy de possums make bigger tracks &#8217;n dat dar grizzly

circumspiciously. H&#8217;m! dat lib b&#8217;ar git &#8217;is head

<p>&#8220;Nomad heap &#8217;fraid; bear all same raccoon,&#8221; put in
Little Cayuse.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Hickok grinned at the &#8220;kidding&#8221; of
the old trapper, but offered no comment. They kept
their eyes open for the appearance of the animal that had
made the track, for he certainly must be a monster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>The pards were riding in the foothills of the Big Horn
range, looking for signs of an Indian encampment and
also a little sport, if it came their way. They had found
no signs of Indians since leaving the plain, but evidences
of bear were plentiful.</p>

<p>The party separated slightly, keeping always within
hailing distance, but beating the bush as their horses
picked their way over the uneven footing.</p>

<p>Presently there was a shot, followed by eight more as
fast as old Skibo could pump his Spencer carbine, and
then there was a wild whoop, a crashing of the underbrush,
and Skibo&#8217;s horse went plunging down the bluff,
with the darky clinging for dear life and an enormous
grizzly in close pursuit.</p>

<p>The pards saw that it would be serious for the colored
member if he should be swept from his terrified horse,
which was making for the open land with all the speed
it could muster with a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound
negro on its back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear heap plenty bigger caballo,&#8221; said Cayuse, as he
turned in pursuit. The other pards dashed down the
mountain with as much speed as was consistent with the
rough footing.</p>

<p>As they burst through a thicket of evergreen near the
foot of the mountain they obtained a good view of Skibo
clinging with his arms around the neck of his horse,
which was still dashing madly out upon the plain, and the
wounded bear shacking after at his best speed.</p>

<p>Then old Nomad arose to the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hy, thar! Skibo; how &#8217;bout them Virginy possums
now? Ef yer likes possum meat he&#8217;p yerself. Et&#8217;s free,
Skibo; don&#8217;t be bashful. Git yer tarnation jawers onter
et an&#8217; chaw ter yer heart&#8217;s content. Cyan&#8217;t yer ketch
&#8217;im, Skibo? Never mind; yer doin&#8217; well, an&#8217; I opines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ye&#8217;ll git &#8217;im by an&#8217; by, ef yer hoss hol&#8217;s out. Git er
goin&#8217;, Skibo, an&#8217; don&#8217;t let thet thar possum git erway
f&#8217;m ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to Cayuse, the trapper continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t yer git out thar an&#8217; he&#8217;p yer brother?
Mebbe &#8217;tain&#8217;t possum, arter all; mebbe et&#8217;s coon, er a
hedgehog. Git yer pied pony er-goin&#8217; an&#8217; ketch ther
varmint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Skibo heard the shouts and laughter behind him and
looked about. He saw that his horse could now outfoot
the bear, so he began a large circle back toward the
point where he had made a somewhat hurried dash upon
the plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyar, Skibo, doan&#8217;t bring ther varmint back this way
till yer tie &#8217;is feet. Quit it, yer dar-devil!&#8221; called
Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! Nick; take yo&#8217; ole beah; Ah ain&#8217; done los&#8217;
no beahs.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the laugh that followed Tootsie&#8217;s exuberance of
spirits got the best of him, and he suddenly blew a loud
and long series of toots on his bugle.</p>

<p>The bear stopped, looked up at the group, sniffed the
air suspiciously, and started to investigate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyar comes yer coon, Cayuse! Now&#8217;s yer time ter
ketch &#8217;im. Recomember, papoose, no foul holts now,
but fair ketch-es-ketch-ken, an&#8217; ef yer gits &#8217;im yer welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nomad gave Hide-rack a slap and dashed out on the
plain.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Hickok sat on their horses a little
apart from the others, enjoying the chase. They were
ready to take a hand at any time their services might
be needed, but were inclined to wait and see what the
others would do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>Nomad, too, was inclined to take revenge by not
raising a rifle against the enraged grizzly.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse&#8217;s pinto would not face the bear for a
moment, but dashed madly away.</p>

<p>Tootsie was the only one left, and the bear made
straight for him and his trembling horse. The boy blew
a stiff blast at the advancing beast and then dashed
away, with the bear in pursuit.</p>

<p>As he galloped Tootsie turned in the saddle and blew
the &#8220;advance&#8221; at the bear, and a moment later the
&#8220;charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bear was doing his best at both orders, but the
fleet bay mare was too swift for him, and at last he
gave it up and turned to sniff toward some of the others.</p>

<p>Tootsie was on the alert, and rode back, stopping a
few rods from the bear to serenade him.</p>

<p>The bear looked at the bugler in disgust for a moment,
and then started slowly back toward the mountain.
Tootsie galloped alongside, far enough away for
safety, and continued to serenade the monster.</p>

<p>The animal stopped several times, and, sitting on its
haunches, looked quizzically at the boy with the bugle;
then he would move on slowly. At last he sat up and,
sticking his nose in air, emitted a mournful howl that
made the pards shout with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t yer shoot &#8217;im, Tootsie?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t my bear!&#8221; yelled Tootsie, who was having
fun enough with the animal as it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef yer ever wants ter kill er grizzly now&#8217;s yer chanst,
boy&mdash;take &#8217;im in ther front when &#8217;e throws &#8217;is head back
ter holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d rather let &#8217;im go. Perhaps he&#8217;ll ketch an
Injun some day, an&#8217; that&#8217;s excuse enough for livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>The bear had started on again, but when Tootsie
dashed up beside and blew a long blast at him the animal
again sat up and howled mournfully. Whenever he
stopped Tootsie again blew at him and the bear gave
vent to that mournful sound.</p>

<p>Again and again the laughable performance was repeated,
when suddenly the bear tipped over backward,
kicked a few times, and died.</p>

<p>One of Skibo&#8217;s bullets had done its work, after all.</p>

<p>While watching the sport the keen eyes of Buffalo
Bill had discovered a side show. His eye had suddenly
caught a flash from the top of a bluff five hundred yards
away, and he had kept watch of that point while apparently
giving his whole attention to the fun in hand.</p>

<p>Falling back until he was in the rear of his pards,
the scout quietly pulled his glass and studied the bluff.
His suspicions were confirmed. Peering out from various
hiding places were a score or more of Indians, who
had been attracted by the hubbub.</p>

<p>They watched the performance with apparently increasing
curiosity and amazement, even crawling out
from their hiding places in order to acquire a better view.</p>

<p>When the bear sat up and howled so disconsolately
they exchanged excited remarks and gestures, and repeated
these every time the act occurred.</p>

<p>The climax came when the bear fell over dead. The
Indians seemed dumb for a moment and then fled. Five
minutes later the scout saw them darting around a bluff
that sat out into the plain, and then disappear as fast as
their ponies could carry them.</p>

<p>The Indians believed the boy had killed the enormous
grizzly in some mysterious manner. They probably
linked this with recent incidents in which the sound of
a bugle had invariably spelled disaster for them.</p>

<small>WONDERS OF THE SACRED MOUNTAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>On the appointed day Buffalo Bill and the pards who
accompanied him on the previous trip rode northward to
visit the &#8220;Daughter of the Moon.&#8221; On the way out the
pards wondered if the &#8220;Queen of the Stars&#8221; would be
there to greet them, or were they going on a fool&#8217;s errand?</p>

<p>No one was in sight as they approached the butte
which the Indians called &#8220;Sacred Mountain.&#8221; They rode
entirely around the cone and scanned the plain in all directions.
Not a living thing was to be seen besides the
birds and a solitary antelope a mile away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye say ter thet, Buffler?&#8221; asked Nomad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better put our horses down in the
crevasse, where they can&#8217;t be seen from the plain, and
then hang out here and smoke and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses were snugly corralled in the rock-bound
fissure, where a savage ten rods distant could not discover
them. It was an ideal hiding place, and half a
dozen well-armed men could defend it against a regiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I blow &#8216;general&#8217; on my bugle?&#8221; suggested
Tootsie, when arrangements had been completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, if you please,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the bugle call, Miss Mona appeared
at the top of the mountain. She waved her hand
in greeting and then disappeared.</p>

<p>The pards wondered what the next move would be,
when the girl suddenly came out from among the horses
and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>&#8220;If the gentlemen will kindly step this way they will
be treated to a little surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stepped briskly forward and his pards followed.
They passed the horses in the cleft and came
to what appeared to be an abrupt ending to the crevice;
but the girl turned a sharp angle at the very end and
entered a break underneath the wall forming quite a
respectable room. At one side of this a hole in the rocks
led under the mountain itself. The girl crouched and
entered and the pards kept near her.</p>

<p>After stooping and crawling for a rod or so, the passageway
opened out until they could stand erect in comfort,
in a place lighted by a torch.</p>

<p>The party traversed some distance, and then came into
the bright sunlight again, except that instead of the sunburned
clay and rocks they had left, they saw before
them a magical bower of beauty. Here beautiful flowers
nodded welcome and green grass stood knee-high. Birds
were singing happily, and the whole place seemed the
realm of a fairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew we&#8217;d go ter heaven ef we follered ther angel,&#8221;
said old Nomad decisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to the home of the Daughter of the Moon,&#8221;
said the girl, bowing low in mock gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We accept your splendid hospitality in fear and
trembling, O Queen of the Stars,&#8221; returned Buffalo Bill,
removing his hat and also bowing extravagantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;I will introduce you to
some friends of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She whistled sharply, and from a cluster of conifers
in which the top of a tepee showed, a tall, handsome,
soldierly-looking young man came forth, and leaning on
his arm was a handsome young woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffalo Bill, and your <i>compadres</i>, allow me to introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to you Lieutenant and Mrs. Avery,&#8221; said the girl
of mystery.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and his bride advanced rapidly to greet
the scout and his pards, and general congratulations
followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherley came forward and was introduced, and
soon announced that a luncheon, which had been prepared
in anticipation of the event, was ready to be
served.</p>

<p>And what a joyous occasion it was.</p>

<p>The young officer anxiously asked about everything at
the fort, and was told of all the news, including the attack
on the supply train.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Avery declared that he was well enough
to go on duty now, and he would return to the fort as
soon as the general would send horses.</p>

<p>The scout promised to convey the message, and said
he would guide an escort to the Sacred Mountain for
the officer and his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there were any means of sending word to the fort
we should be pleased to have Buffalo Bill and his pards
remain with us until the Lieutenant and Mrs. Avery return,&#8221;
said Miss Mona.</p>

<p>Cayuse promptly offered to take the message, but
Buffalo Bill demurred, saying that he presumed it would
be best for all to return to the fort, on account of the
horses.</p>

<p>Little Moonbeam instantly overcame that objection by
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;In our farming operations Mrs. Sherley and I have
had use for an Indian corn knife and secured one.
With that we can easily cut grass here and carry it to the
horses. The cavern at the outer end of the passage is
large enough for all of them, and no roving band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Indians would find them there. If they did they would
not dare touch them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Sherley and I have lived here years, and the Indians
have never as yet even discovered the cavern, although
leaving offerings in the crevasse as often as once
a month. Inside the cavern, covered with a flat rock,
is a pool of pure water&mdash;and thus we have the dumb
animals provided for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We accept your hospitality, and if you will produce
the corn knife we will proceed to feed the animals at
once, so that Cayuse may be on his way early in the
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses were led into the cavern and given water
and grass. Then Nomad thought he had better stay with
the animals, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer fear that cantankerous ole sarpint ov er Hide-rack&#8217;ll
git p&#8217;inted in ther wrong direction an&#8217; cut loose
&#8217;th them weepins o&#8217; hisn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Skibo &#8220;reckoned&#8221; he had best remain with Nomad, and
so only the scout and Tootsie were left with the Averys
and their hostesses.</p>

<p>After Cayuse had been gone some time Miss Mona
invited the scout to accompany her to the top of the
wall. Tootsie was asleep in the grass and the lieutenant
and his bride had retired to their bower.</p>

<p>Far to the south could be seen Little Cayuse, jogging
along toward the fort. The girl became greatly interested
in the scout&#8217;s field glass, never having seen one
before. She was delighted with the way it jumped
Cayuse back a mile or so in his journey, and she laughingly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a trim little Indian he is! I can see his feather
with the glass.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>Several miles to the westward a small herd of buffalo
were feeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;A peaceful scene,&#8221; said the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and how great and desolate it is! Except for
this little garden of Eden below, it is two miles to grass
and water&mdash;yet I love it and hate to leave it, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and looked curiously at the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want your advice,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the best I have in stock,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a glimpse of my own people and a dream
of the great world beyond where I can see. They have
told me of the wonders of the cities and the great schools
of girls, where they learn so much that I yearn to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love this place and Mrs. Sherley is contented, but
I feel as if there were something more in the world for
us. I long for companionship of my own age&mdash;sweet
girls who would put their soft arms around me and
love me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Cody, when I think of these things it seems
I cannot wait. And yet, where should I go and what
should I do? Neither Mrs. Sherley nor I have a relative
in the world of whom we know or can ever expect
to find. What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl had worked her feelings up to the point of
tears, when the scout interposed to give her opportunity
to control herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had means to go direct to some Eastern school,
with Mrs. Sherley to accompany you and remain with
you, it would be well enough for you to start out for an
education; but the pitfalls of civilization, before a young
lady of your beauty, are far more numerous and dangerous
than those of the Bad Lands, because of the attractiveness
of one and the repulsiveness of the other.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>The girl looked at him, not half understanding his
meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are thousands of men with much money and
little honor who are on the watch for such innocents as
you are. If you had friends with whom you could remain
and attend school, Mrs. Sherley could readily find
employment that would pay the way for both of you.
Perhaps we can bring it about through the families of
some of the military men. Keep up your courage and I
will see what can be done; but I cannot allow this opportunity
to pass and neglect to warn you, if you go out in
the world, to be suspicious of everything, and place yourself
under the guidance of an experienced and reliable
female friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have gone on, but the girl, whose eyes had
fixed upon him in wrapt attention, turned away for a
moment, and then she sprang up and extended her hands
in mute greeting toward a pitiful little figure making its
way across the plain toward them.</p>

<p>The scout instantly recognized the little daughter of
Black Coyote.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little thing!&#8221; said the girl, with tears in her
eyes and her heart full of pity. &#8220;Black Coyote is dead.
He wished to die there where his tribe deserted him. He
would not come here and the child would not leave him.
I told her to come to me when the Great Spirit came
for her father. She is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>She watched the child for a moment, and turning to
the scout, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three of us now, but the case is not hopeless.
I have much more to talk to you about to-morrow&mdash;or
by this evening&#8217;s moonlight. Let us go down and
meet Laughing Water.&#8221;</p>

<small>LITTLE CAYUSE MISSING.</small></h2></div>


<p>Buffalo Bill expected a detachment of cavalry would
arrive the next forenoon, and gave himself over to keen
enjoyment of this homelike retreat in the heart of an
almost barren country. Here he could lie on the grass
at evening and look up at the stars without the momentary
expectancy of that charming visitor, the rattlesnake.
Neither did he feel obliged to sleep with one
eye open to guard against surprise by Indians. No
sound of the howling coyote came to him here, and the
odors of delicate flowers and pungent herbs tickled his
nostrils.</p>

<p>And not the least of the attractions was the charming
hostess, whose innocent, confiding nature appealed
to all the real manliness in such men of honor as the
famous scout. Mrs. Sherley, too&mdash;a motherly soul&mdash;sent
Buffalo Bill back to childhood&#8217;s days. It had been a
long time since the scout had felt so care-free and wholly
at ease and peace.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Avery told to the scout the story of his
fight and capture, and how Little Moonbeam had rescued
them from the Indians. The lieutenant openly expressed
his respect and admiration for the girl, and remarked
to the scout his desire to aid in placing her in
the advantages of an Eastern city, where she not only
could go to school, but could study music, both vocal
and instrumental.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of your people in the East?&#8221; the scout asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not live in a city which furnishes the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
this girl requires. But my wife&#8217;s people are
ideally located. My wife and I have talked much of it
in the last few days, but have not touched on the matter
to the girl herself. So far as we knew she had no desire
to leave this beautiful oasis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Until their pipes had gone out the scout and lieutenant
discussed the girl&#8217;s future, which always included
Mrs. Sherley and the little Indian maiden. They came
to a very definite understanding, and promised to consider
ways and means at a future sitting. In the meantime,
Buffalo Bill would once more confer with the girl.</p>

<p>At noon the following day no party had come from
the fort for Lieutenant Avery and his wife, neither had
a messenger appeared.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was more or less chagrined. He had
felt that the commander and his brother officers would
be so glad to hear that he was alive that they would
hasten to escort him back to the fort and hold a general
jollification in his honor.</p>

<p>As night came on no one was in sight on the plain,
so far as the scout&#8217;s field glass would reveal from the
top of the butte.</p>

<p>Old Nomad had become uneasy and declared that
something had gone wrong with Cayuse. He, Nomad,
was for putting off to discover its meaning. He would
go through to the fort and, if Cayuse had not arrived,
search for the Piute pard.</p>

<p>The scout would not agree to this proposition, but
decided to go himself to the fort, leaving the others
at the sacred mountain, and telling them not to be uneasy
if he did not return for several days. He expressed
the utmost confidence in the ability of Little Cayuse
to come out on top, but if the Piute had not reached
the fort, he, the scout, should go into the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
looking for the Indian pard. He still believed the Ogallalas
had a village there and were conducting their raids
from such a centre.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark the scout mounted Bear Paw
and set out. Before leaving he cautioned Nomad and
Skibo to be watchful and keep close to the rocks until
he returned, or an escort came for Lieutenant Avery.</p>

<p>It was a lonely night ride to the fort, but without
adventure of any sort. Little Cayuse had not been seen.
The scout told the general of the finding of Lieutenant
Avery and his wife, and that the officer was fully recovered
and ready to return to the fort.</p>

<p>The general was rejoiced at this piece of good news
and promised to send horses and an escort at once.</p>

<p>But the scout&#8217;s work was just begun. What had become
of Little Cayuse? He had no doubt that Indians
were at the bottom of Cayuse&#8217;s disappearance, but how
they had succeeded in capturing the wily Piute on the
open plain puzzled the scout.</p>

<p>He resolved to sleep until daylight and then set out
on a blind trail and trust to luck, or his intuitive bent
toward a solution of such problems.</p>

<p>At sunrise a detachment of fifty cavalrymen, leading
two extra horses, set out for the sacred mountain,
Buffalo Bill and Hickok riding with them for a mile
or two and then turning away toward the Big Horn
range.</p>

<p>The scout and Wild Bill struck the mouth of the
ca√±on previously referred to by Wild Bill in speaking
to Captain Smith. On several occasions Hickok had
suggested a ride to this ca√±on, but some excuse had
been found by the captain each time to ride in another
direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>Hickok told Buffalo Bill, as they rode slowly on
toward the mountains, all that he had learned from
Captain Smith, and also of his suspicions aroused by
certain incidents.</p>

<p>The previous evening an apparently old and decrepit
Indian had come to the fort begging. He asked to see
Captain Smith, as that officer had been generous to
him at other visits. The captain was called, held a
few moments&#8217; low and hurried conversation with the
beggar, gave the latter food and tobacco and something
else that looked like a small missive, and then stalked
back toward his quarters, swearing about &#8220;these Indian
beggars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wild Bill had quietly slipped out and followed the
Indian, who became an active young buck the moment
he was outside the fort, and in an arroyo half a mile
away, mounted a pony and galloped toward the western
hills.</p>

<p>The Laramie man believed the Indian had come for
a message and had borne one to Captain Smith. He
had also discovered enough to convince him that Captain
Smith had arranged with the Indians to be on the
watch for Lieutenant Avery and to see that he did not
return to the fort. By Captain Smith&#8217;s own words he
was glad Avery was out of the way. He had said, when
slightly under the influence of liquor, that Avery was an
upstart and wanted to ride over his superiors. But
that he&mdash;Avery&mdash;had run against a snag when he attempted
to ride over Price, the Indian agent.</p>

<p>Captain Smith&#8217;s version of the affair was that Avery
had insulted a girl who was out walking with Price
and the latter had knocked the officer down. Smith
had received a letter from Price describing the situation
and telling him that through Avery&#8217;s attempts the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
was trumping up false charges against him&mdash;Price&mdash;and
were trying to down him.</p>

<p>Hickok had apparently accepted Captain Smith&#8217;s version,
not telling of his own experience with Price and
the latter&#8217;s intimate association with Bloody Ike, the
cutthroat. Hickok also learned that Captain Smith&#8217;s
half-brother was an officer in the service along the
Yellowstone. This half-brother had married Price&#8217;s
sister and the Indian agent&#8217;s influence in former years
had done much to promote his brother-in-law in the
service.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Price escapes again we shall know to whom to
look for an explanation,&#8221; said Buffalo Bill quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely; and if there is any deviltry carried on here
by the Indians that requires knowledge of the fort and
troops we shall know pretty well who furnished the information,&#8221;
returned Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are getting into a pretty rough country for
horses,&#8221; said the scout presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; suppose we leave them in some secluded spot
where they can feed, and proceed on foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that the best plan, and here is the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had arrived at the mouth of a little blind
ca√±on, well hidden by evergreen growth. The horses
were led beyond the fringe of green to a grassy plot
and tethered there, the scouts removing the saddles and
hiding them among the rocks.</p>

<p>The way became more difficult as they advanced until
they were clambering up rock-bound heights, clinging
to narrow ledges and scrubby cedars, far above the
ca√±on.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the day and the pards thus
far had seen neither Indians nor large animals of any
species. Higher up and beyond appeared to be a barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and almost impassable waste of rock, with here and
there a stunted cedar or pine finding footing. To the
left hung an immense bald dome of granite, and hither
they bent their steps.</p>

<p>Panting and weary from the hard climb they found
themselves at an elevation overlooking a vast expanse of
country, both mountains and the plains beyond. The
fort was distinctly visible and with the field glass men
and animals were easily distinguished. Far to the
northward the square-topped butte, the home of the
queen of the stars, was to be seen.</p>

<p>That which interested the pards more, at this time,
was the character of country immediately surrounding
them. They could follow the windings of the ca√±on
until it ended in a precipitous wall above which lay a
broad plateau. To them it looked as though by following
the gorge to the end and climbing the wall of the
cul-de-sac, the high land, which was heavily timbered
and surrounded by peaks, might be reached with comparative
ease. They wished now that they had continued
up the ca√±on instead of leaving their horses.</p>

<p>As they were studying the walls of the ca√±on through
their glasses, an Indian appeared among the trees at
the edge of the plateau and began a descent into the
gulch. Others followed rapidly until twelve had disappeared
in the depths below the scout&#8217;s line of vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;The village is on that wooded mountain plain,&#8221; said
the scout decisively, &#8220;and their horses are anchored in
the ca√±on below. There is the seat of all the trouble
in this part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIII.<br />

<small>CAYUSE FINDS OLD ENEMIES.</small></h2></div>


<p>Little Cayuse&#8217;s trim figure sat astride the pinto Navi
with all the pride of a king, as he rode out of view of the
sacred mountain that afternoon.</p>

<p>Just now Little Cayuse was executing an important
commission for Pa-e-has-ka, and the boy&#8217;s native pride
in positions of trust bade him carry it out with celerity.</p>

<p>As he rode the Indian youth&#8217;s eyes constantly swept
the plain, not from fear or nervousness, but from force
of habit. Indeed, with Navi under him the boy felt
that he had no cause to fear anything that stalked
the plain, for Navi was tireless and as fleet as the
wind.</p>

<p>But Cayuse had not foreseen all the events of the
afternoon. As he gazed at a single white spot on the
skyline he became convinced that it was a prairie
schooner. It seemed to be moving west across his line
of travel.</p>

<p>As it came nearer the young Indian could see that
the wagon was drawn by four mules which were, apparently,
driven by a woman. An Indian on a pony was
riding in the wake of the wagon and seemed to be
directing the course of this ship of the plains.</p>

<p>The wagon halted where the travelers&#8217; line intersected
that of Little Cayuse and waited for him to come
up. Cayuse believed it to be a party of white emigrants
who were looking for the fort and had missed the trail
while attempting to travel at night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>The woman who was driving hailed the Piute as he
drew near and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Fort Phil Kearney?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cayuse pointed down the route he was pursuing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you show us the way?&#8221; the woman asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh,&#8221; answered the Piute, although he did not
care to delay his own trip by bothering with the outfit.</p>

<p>A man in the interior of the big white wagon, and
whose eyes Cayuse could see at an aperture in the canvas,
said something in a low voice to the woman at the
lines. She looked hard at Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, boy?&#8221; the woman asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All same Little Cayuse,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I thought,&#8221; said a gruff voice within.</p>

<p>The Indian who accompanied the outfit had ridden
around the wagon and stopped near the Piute, when
suddenly a double-barreled gun was poked out by the
side of the woman and a man&#8217;s head and shoulders appeared,
as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands up, Cayuse, and no monkey business. Take
his arms and hitch his pony to yours, Slow Foot; then
tie Cayuse&#8217;s feet together under his pony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Cayuse had not the slightest chance of escape
against such treachery. The people he had mistaken
for harmless travelers had proven banditti of a sort the
Indian boy had never met. He could not imagine what
these white people should want of him, especially if they
were going to the fort, where he would be known and
released on Wild Bill&#8217;s word.</p>

<p>The voice of the man inside had a familiar sound,
but the Piute could not recall its owner. The voice
of the woman was hoarse and strained, probably from
shouting to the mules.</p>

<p>When Little Cayuse had been securely bound, the outfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
moved ahead in the direction it had been pursuing&mdash;toward
the mountains.</p>

<p>As they approached the mouth of a ca√±on a party
of Indians rode out and, wheeling, galloped toward
them. The Indian called Slow Foot rode on ahead,
and after exchanging a few words with the leader of
the party of a dozen warriors, they dashed away and
the schooner entered the gorge.</p>

<p>For some distance the wagon bounced over the
rocks and logs of the ca√±on and then all were told to dismount.
The wagon was pulled into a thicket by the Indian,
the man with whiskers, and the woman, who, Cayuse
discovered, wore a woman&#8217;s garment and shaker
bonnet over a man&#8217;s clothing and face.</p>

<p>The outfit passed as a frontiersman and his wife and
household goods, wherever they met white people, and
when they met reds the Indian guide explained to them
that these were white refugees who were fleeing from
their own people to take up their abode with the red
brothers.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse could now see how he had been entrapped,
but he was not yet able to understand how
he came to be known and why he was wanted.</p>

<p>The party made its way up the bed of the ca√±on for
probably three miles and then came to the end of it.
They were confronted by a solid wall, probably one hundred
feet high.</p>

<p>Near the end of the ca√±on was quite a growth of
conifers, and behind this hedge a green little valley of
swale land. Here a herd of ponies were tethered, and
with these Navi and the mules were left.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse&#8217;s hands were tied behind him and one
of the white men held the end of the lariat, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
quartette toiled up the side of the mountain. The one
dressed as a woman had discarded that garb, after
there was little or no danger of meeting white people.</p>

<p>At the top of the wall the rocks seemed to fall away
for a few rods to a flat-bottomed timber land, under
which the moss was soft and green. The growth was
protected from the high winds by the surrounding peaks.</p>

<p>The Indian Slow Foot led the way through the shadowy
forest, where only the sighing of the winds in
the evergreens overhead and the twitter of birds in
the branches could be heard. In that soft, green moss
not the sound of a footfall was heard, and after they
had passed the moss sprang back into place, leaving no
trail. It was damp, and dark, and velvety; pleasing to
the eyes and to the feet.</p>

<p>Cayuse, who had spent the most of his life on the
plains, from Mexico to Montana, had never seen anything
like this. It was much as he had pictured the
happy hunting ground&mdash;cool, and soft, and free from
alkali dust, with plenty of dark pools for water and
fish, fat antelope to be seen among the trees, where
the red men swung and smoked from moon to moon.</p>

<p>Far across this beautiful land of trees they at last
heard the shouts of children and the barking of dogs.
Ten minutes later they came upon a group of tepees
and found themselves in an Indian village, where fat
and lazy bucks lay smoking and enjoying the plunder
taken from the white settlers and supply trains, and
stolen from the forts; all this in addition to the bounty
of the Great Father at Washington.</p>

<p>Preparation seemed to have been made for the two
white men, and they were led direct to a tepee, where
they proceeded to make themselves at home.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse was left bound in the care of a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of braves, whose only notice of the young Piute was to
sneer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pai-ute! Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Cayuse disdained to make reply. His captors
were the hated Sioux. He could die without a
murmur, if they tortured him, but he would not talk to
them.</p>

<p>In a cleared space where the trees and stumps had
been grubbed away, some sort of a dance was being
held. Two circles had been formed around a mystery
pole. The cowskin drums boomed, and men of deeds
composed the inner circle in their war finery and with
buffalo-horn dancing clubs.</p>

<p>These warriors shook their clubs at the outer circle
and repeated their deeds of daring. When this was
done the drums boomed again and the warriors of the
inner circle marched up to the mystery pole and then
suddenly sprang back and danced about it, part going
one way and part the other.</p>

<p>The drums boomed once more and ceased and the
dancing warriors began to chant. After a time these
men took seats and the speechmaking began. At the
end of each exploit related the drums were pounded
furiously.</p>

<p>It was a sample day of the way these red men lived
in luxury&mdash;according to the red man&#8217;s notion of luxury&mdash;on
the loot wrung from the daring white men who
were every day pushing the borders of civilization farther
toward the setting sun, and opening a vast domain
of wealth and happiness then infested by Indians and
white pirates of the plains.</p>

<p>The sport becoming boisterous, the two white men
came forth to witness the ceremonies. They had shed
much of their outer garments, including the hair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
beard which had been used for disguise, and Little
Cayuse instantly recognized his old friends of the Gallatin
Valley&mdash;Price, the Indian agent, and Bloody Ike,
the ex-miner and blasting expert.</p>

<p>Cayuse now understood how he came to be known
to them and why he was wanted by them. The Piute
fully realized the seriousness of his situation and resolved
to escape, even if by taking most desperate risks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIV.<br />

<small>THE PARDS VISIT THE INDIANS.</small></h2></div>


<p>It did not take long for the scout and Hickok to
decide to pay the wooded area among the mountain tops
a visit. They were probably two hundred feet above
the woodland, and hoped they could make their way down
the side with ease.</p>

<p>It proved no easy task and the last lap was a hard
one. At the edge of the woodland was a perpendicular
drop, an unscalable cliff as far as they could
discover entirely around that side of the great basin,
varying in height from thirty to seventy feet.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when they had hidden the saddles, they
had taken off their lariats, and retained them for possible
use in mountain climbing.</p>

<p>They selected a spot where the evergreens grew close
to the wall and the scout fastened one end of his lariat
to a stout cedar and slid over the rim. He landed
lightly in the moss at the base and then Hickok followed.</p>

<p>The lariat was left hanging for future use, and the
pair, marking well the spot, set out on a tour of inspection.
Their progress in the moist, springy moss
was noiseless, but they realized that quick-eyed Indians
on the watch could also move as noiselessly as
they.</p>

<p>The pards traveled a rod or two apart and constantly
scanned their surroundings. They were in the
enemy&#8217;s country and it behooved them to exercise great
caution.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>At last the scout paused to listen. He had caught
the sound of a human voice. It was far away across
the forest, but it was unmistakably the call of a man.</p>

<p>The answer came and the pards stared at each other
in amazement&mdash;the voice was that of a white man, and
an American.</p>

<p>As the pards approached, the voices became more distinct,
and at last they could distinguish words exchanged
between two men who were some distance apart and
carrying on a conversation. The men were busy at some
labor, and presently the scouts made out that the strangers
were picking boughs, probably for a bunk.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was surprised again that whites should
be here and apparently so free from fear of interruption
by red men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could they be?&#8221;</p>

<p>They might be miners, but this location must be at
least two miles from the seams and gashes of the mountain
rock, in any direction. They could not be mining
in the centre of this deep, mucky soil that furnished
food for a great forest.</p>

<p>The pards crept nearer, and at last, secreted behind
evergreen shrubs, could see the men plainly.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill rubbed his eyes, looked again, and then
turned to glance questioningly at Hickok.</p>

<p>The Laramie man stared at the strangers, scratched
his head, pulled out his field glass and tried to see them
through it, and then turned to the scout.</p>

<p>Both looked again at the men who were bundling
up their boughs to carry away. Buffalo Bill stole over
toward his pard and Hickok hitched nearer the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are my eyes on duty?&#8221; whispered the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;They look all right to me, but I fear mine are out
for a joke,&#8221; returned Hickok.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>&#8220;Who do you call that pair?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if my eyes ain&#8217;t lying and these woods are
not playing the deuce with my think machine, I&#8217;ve been
looking at that knave Price and his worse comrade,
Bloody Ike. How do they look to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve expressed my feelings,&#8221; said the scout. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
follow them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to trail Price and his partner
to the Indian village without being discovered,
for the two men seemed to have no thought of interruption.</p>

<p>Hiding in the thick evergreens for several hours the
pards studied the village from all sides. They wished
to know the strength of the camp and if they had any
prisoners. Price and Ike moved about at will and
might have owned the village, from all appearances.</p>

<p>The pards decided that the village contained about
one hundred people&mdash;bucks, squaws, and papooses. With
the party they had seen set out in the morning they believed
there might be sixty warriors.</p>

<p>The camp was as peaceful as a country village on
Sunday. None seemed to expect visitors or to care to
exert themselves enough to do guard duty. They evidently
considered that the guard in the ca√±on with the
ponies was sufficient.</p>

<p>The camp was admirably located for summer and
winter quarters, the forest breaking the cold winds
and hot sun and furnishing abundant fuel, while water
was convenient and plenty.</p>

<p>One tepee was guarded by two smoking, sleepy bucks,
and securing a good position, Buffalo Bill waited patiently,
hour after hour, for some one to pull aside the
flap and reveal the interior.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>At last Price himself appeared and, looking in, sang
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cayuse, you red dog, how do you like it?
Guess Buffalo Bill himself can&#8217;t save you this time.
These red brothers of yours are planning on a sort of
Thanksgiving celebration, and you are to be the roast
turkey. Never mind, though, Piute, when I see Cody
I&#8217;ll tell him you cried like a spanked papoose and wanted
to go home to ma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Price turned away, grinning, but if Cayuse made
any reply it was so low that the scout could not hear it.</p>

<p>The pards withdrew, at last, to some distance from
the village, where they could talk over what they had
seen.</p>

<p>After comparing notes they decided to await darkness
and once more visit the village. They had spent
many hours in reconnoitring the camp, and night was
at hand by the time they had paid their compliments to
the haversacks.</p>

<p>The Indians seemed to have gathered around the
camp fires between the rows of tepees to listen to the
stories of the day&#8217;s hunt by the returned warriors. They
had killed twenty buffaloes and had had a brush with
a great army of pony soldiers.</p>

<p>The Indians had called at the sacred mountain to
leave a tender young cow buffalo for the daughter
of the moon, when they saw the pony soldiers approaching.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of the white warriors, according
to their tale, and the red men had attacked them
and slain many, but had escaped without a wound
themselves. The white warriors were coming to make
offering at the sacred mountain, the red men believed.</p>

<p>Price and Ike were present, and the former made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
speech setting forth the valor and bravery of the red
warriors, and telling them that the white men were becoming
afraid of the Sioux braves and would be swept
back across the great river and forever leave the plains
for the Indians. He was cheered and the cowskin drums
were beaten wildly.</p>

<p>But while this was going on Buffalo Bill and Hickok
had not been idle. They readily selected the tepee in
which Cayuse was confined, and a sharp knife running
down through the buffalo skin back gave no sound
that could be heard above the hubbub at the fires.</p>

<p>An Indian sat on either side of the front of the tepee,
as they had done in the afternoon, but they were so
engrossed with the performance as to be oblivious to
the light sounds made by the scout as he entered the
wigwam through the slit in the back.</p>

<p>The firelight shone in past the flap and revealed to
the scout that Little Cayuse was not there.</p>

<p>At first the scout feared he had entered the wrong
tepee, but he soon reassured himself by finding the
thongs that had bound the Piute&#8217;s feet and hands.</p>

<p>Little Cayuse had made his escape from the village
unaided, but whether he could manage to pass the guard
at the head of the ca√±on before he was missed was
another story.</p>

<p>The scout made haste to find Hickok and the two
set out for the ca√±on, realizing that the moment the
alarm was sounded that the prisoner had escaped from
the tepee an attempt would be made to cut off his
escape down the narrow, difficult trail to the ca√±on.</p>

<p>Every moment they expected to hear shouts of enraged
savages behind them, and knew that in their hurried
progress through the forest they were likely to step
into the arms of warriors at any instant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>But they reached the incline that led up out of the
wooded basin before the descent to the ca√±on begun,
without incident. As they left the moss for the rocks
they could see the top of the wall plainly outlined
against the sky&mdash;and at that moment at the crest could
be seen a crouching, silent figure just going over the
rim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cayuse,&#8221; spoke the scout in a low tone, and the
figure paused, then slid back toward them.</p>

<p>It was the Indian pard, sure enough, and now there
were three to steal down by the Indian guard in the
ca√±on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how many bucks guard the ponies?&#8221;
the scout asked of Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me see t&#8217;ree; mebbe more, but me no see um.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the pards reached the foot of the trail there
was some sort of a commotion among the ponies. They
were kicking and fighting among themselves, and soon
two Indians appeared with torches and clubs to quell
the riot.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Hickok stole around to that side
of the opening to await the return of the Indians, and
Cayuse went searching for another red man.</p>

<p>When the twain came back talking together, their
torches gone out, they walked into two pair of powerful
arms, and found their windpipes closed before they
could emit a sound.</p>

<p>The struggle over, the Indians were bound and
gagged and dragged to one side where they would be
out of the way and not likely to be discovered.</p>

<p>About this time, at only a few rods distant, the scout
heard a grunt of surprise followed by a heavy blow and
a rustling in the underbrush. He approached cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and saw a dark form at work over another which was
lying on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-s-t!&#8221; hissed the scout, and Cayuse answered in a
low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get him?&#8221; asked the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh; him have Cayuse&#8217;s belt and knife. All same
bump him head hard, no make um noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>This one, like the others, was gagged and tied up
like a sheep for market, and dragged away.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was surprised that Cayuse&#8217;s absence at
the village had not been discovered and an alarm sounded
before this, but he determined to improve the opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you find Navi in the dark?&#8221; he asked of Cayuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuh; Navi smell Cayuse, come all same dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Get your pinto as soon as possible and we
will turn the others down the ca√±on.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another half hour the cavalcade of riderless ponies
thundered out of the mouth of the ca√±on upon the plain,
free for a time of all restraint, and bound to make the
most of it until recaptured.</p>

<p>The scout and Hickok found their horses where they
had left them, and were soon riding hard for the fort
to bring a force to capture the village.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLV.<br />

<small>WILD BILL&#8217;S TASK.</small></h2></div>


<p>To Wild Bill fell the duty of leading a strong force
of cavalry back to the ca√±on that night, while the scout
and Little Cayuse galloped northward to relieve the anxiety
of Nomad and Skibo on guard at the sacred mountain.</p>

<p>The Averys had been escorted back to the fort and
properly serenaded by the soldiers and dined by the
officers, but Nomad and Skibo stayed at their post, according
to Buffalo Bill&#8217;s orders, and Tootsie remained
with Mona and Mrs. Sherley.</p>

<p>The scout wished to confer with Mona again before
he should leave that part of the country, and the excuse
was thus presented.</p>

<p>Before the cavalry force set out, Wild Bill assured
the scout that Price and Bloody Ike would come back
with him, dead or alive, whether the Indians were
brought in or not.</p>

<p>The sacred mountain was reached some time before
daylight and Nomad and Skibo routed out to be told the
news.</p>

<p>Until sunup the pards sat and smoked and discussed
the events of the past few weeks. In some ways it had
been one of the most remarkable of their exploits, but
more real enjoyment had crept in with the danger and
strife of the border life than either of the pards remembered
on any previous expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet thar queen o&#8217; ther stars is sweet an&#8217; purty &#8217;nuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
ter make er man fergit thet he likes ter chase Injuns,&#8221;
remarked Nomad by way of explaining his present peace
of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, yah! She am de sweetes&#8217; li&#8217;l&#8217; plum Ah ever
seen in long dresses, &#8217;cep&#8217; li&#8217;l&#8217; Miss Comfort down on
de Popo-agie,&#8221; added Skibo loyally.</p>

<p>For once Nomad and Skibo agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is Tootsie&#8217;s opinion of Miss Mona?&#8221; asked
the scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ther lad is wishin&#8217; he was &#8217;bout ten y&#8217;ars older, I&#8217;ll
bet Hide-rack ergin er grasshopper,&#8221; laughed Nomad.
&#8220;Ther bye sticks to her like death to er dead coon,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>Just then Tootsie&#8217;s bugle sounded from the top of
the rock, and was followed by the merry laugh of
the girl. The pards heard her exclaim:</p>

<p>&#8220;You beat me up the rocks, Tootsie, but you couldn&#8217;t
do it after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could if Mrs. Sherley didn&#8217;t make the grub so
good,&#8221; retorted the boy.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stepped out in view and whistled, and
was at once greeted with merry shouts of welcome
as the pair hurried away to the underground passage.</p>

<p>After Little Moonbeam had been told of the safe arrival
at the fort of Lieutenant and Mrs. Avery, the
scout went inside with the girl and Tootsie. There Little
Moonbeam at once launched upon the subject nearest
her heart.</p>

<p>She told the scout of a strange discovery she had
made while at work in one corner of the newly cultivated
garden. She had unearthed a quantity of what
she believed to be pure gold, from its color and weight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
She wished the scout to examine it and pass judgment.</p>

<p>Then the scout remembered the story told him by
the general. He resolved, however, to make no mention
of previous knowledge of the treasure.</p>

<p>It was gold, without doubt, and he told the happy
girl so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I can go to school,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and Mrs. Sherley
and little Laughing Water with me, and Tootsie
and his sisters and Buffalo Bill and his pards must come
and visit us, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for breath and the scout laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a real girl, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why shouldn&#8217;t I be happy, when the good
fairies have provided a way for me to gratify my
greatest desire&mdash;to go to school?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be happy, my dear child,&#8221; said the scout
soberly. &#8220;And no one rejoices in your good fortune
more than I. With my pards I shall be glad to escort
you as far as Leavenworth on your way East. I think
Lieutenant Avery and his wife will accompany you to
the city where her parents live and arrange for your
comfort and school course. The lieutenant will be
granted a furlough to fully recover from his wounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Cody! You have been arranging all this
for me and without knowing where the money was coming
from to pay the bills!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should have asked an appropriation from
Congress to provide for your education as a victim of
its charges, the red men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How splendidly it has come about! Tootsie&#8217;s relatives
also live in the East, and he thinks they may return
next year.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>Thus they rejoiced for a time and then the scout
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My pards and I will return to the fort to give you
time to make your final preparations to leave this
place till your school days are over. Tootsie may remain
if he wishes and can be of service to you. When
shall we return with prairie schooner and cavalry escort
for the &#8216;Queen of the Stars&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one week,&#8221; she answered promptly.</p>

<p>And so it was left for Buffalo Bill to make the final
arrangements at the fort.</p>

<p>As it had been hoped, the Indians did not discover
the loss of Little Cayuse, and were taken completely by
surprise.</p>

<p>They were surrounded in their village and easily
overcome at daylight. Some of the leaders were held
prisoners, but the others sent back to the reservation.</p>

<p>Price and Bloody Ike were once more in the hands
of the army with added charges hanging over them. It
was learned eventually that they had escaped through
the connivance of the brother-in-law of Price, who was
also a half-brother of Captain Smith. The latter was
dismissed from the army for the part he had played,
and his half-brother was given two years in a military
prison in addition to dismissal.</p>

<p>The former Indian agent did not escape this time,
and served a long term in the penitentiary. There was
not much that could be proven directly against Bloody
Ike, but in an attempt to escape he was shot and killed
by a soldier on guard.</p>

<p>Tootsie returned to make glad the hearts of his parents,
after having derived much benefit from his association
with Buffalo Bill and his pards.</p>






<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>The little Indian girl was taken East with Mona and
Mrs. Sherley, and took up school work gladly and with
the promise of rewarding her fair patroness by her good
advancement and of eventually becoming a useful member
of society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>High-brow public opinion has changed radically
during the past few years, so far as
placing a proper valuation on paper-covered
reading matter is concerned.</p>

<p>In the old days, anything between paper
covers was a dime novel and, therefore, to
be avoided as cheap and contaminating.</p>

<p>Since men like Frank O&#8217;Brien have pointed
out to the world the fact that some of the
best literature in the English language first
appeared between paper covers, such books
are welcomed in the best of families.</p>

<p>The STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS are
clean, interesting, and up-to-date. There are
hundreds of different titles, and we invite your
careful consideration of them from a standpoint
of value and of literary excellence.</p>

not remember, that &#8220;Old Curly&#8221; was a name given by his soldiers
to Colonel Custer because of his long, curly hair. The
Indian, who had called Custer &#8220;White-chief-of-the-long-hair,&#8221;
readily adopted the loving title conferred by the dashing colonel&#8217;s
loyal followers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author.</span></p></div>
